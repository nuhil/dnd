McLaren Mercedes drivers snatch the front row for 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix

McLaren Mercedes drivers Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton will start from top of FIA Formula-1 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix race tomorrow at the Hungaroring, Budapest, Hungary.

Exactly as it was in the Monaco Grand Prix earlier this year Alonso stayed in the shadow of his young companion, but at the end of the third he made a successful flying lap on a fresh tyres and won the pole for tomorrow beating Hamilton only by 0.107 of a second.

There was some controversy over this achievement, as Hamilton was unable to start his final lap when Alonso, for unclear reasons, remained standing still at the pit for several seconds after his pit stop finished, with Hamilton forced to wait behind him.

Nick Heidfeld from BMW Sauber surprised the spectators by beating Kimi Räikkönen, the Ferrari driver.

Ferrari itself got poor results - Felipe Massa suffered a car problem, his engine stalled at the far end of the pit-lane, he was unable to compete in the final qualifying session and will start only 14th.

The weekend started reminiscent of the espionage allegation scandal between McLaren and Ferrari teams, when Alonso was freed up from the FIA's official press conference.
