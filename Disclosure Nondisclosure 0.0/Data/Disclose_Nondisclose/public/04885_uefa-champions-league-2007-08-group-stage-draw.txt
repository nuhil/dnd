UEFA Champions League 2007/08: Group Stage Draw

Monaco was the location for the 2007/08 UEFA Champions League group stage draw. Before the draw took place there was a one minute silence in memory of Antonio Puerta who died earlier this week after collapsing during a La Liga match for Sevilla who then died on Tuesday, August 28. Due to this, Sevilla's Champions League qualifier was postponed which resulted in them and AEK Athens being drawn together.

Manchester Utd will play AS Roma again, after beating them in the Final 16 last year, in Group F, whilst Celtic will meet the defending champions AC Milan in Group D. Celtic lost against Milan in the Final 16 last year but will hope to avenge them.

Scottish football club Rangers, how have yet to beat a Spanish side in the Champions League, will get to meet Barcelona in Group E. Rangers also have both the French champions and the German champions, Lyon and Stuttgart.

The full draw is as follows:

Goalkeeper of the Year<br>

Defender of the Year<br>

Midfielder of the Year<br>

Forward of the Year<br>

UEFA Club Footballer of the Year 2007<br>
