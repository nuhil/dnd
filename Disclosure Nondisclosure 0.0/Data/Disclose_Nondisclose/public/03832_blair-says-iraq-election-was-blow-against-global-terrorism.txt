Blair says Iraq election was blow against global terrorism

According to the British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Iraq election was a blow against global terrorism. He vowed to stand by Iraq as it moves to build a democracy and paid tribute to British military personnel who died in a plane crash on election day.

In a nationally broadcast statement, Blair said: "It was moving and humbling for those of us lucky enough to live in a democracy and take it for granted, to see the enthusiasm and the simple determination, the clear sight of courage of millions of Iraqis that came out to vote for the first time in their lives, despite the terrorism, despite the threats, despite the dangers...Democracy in Iraq is not just good for Iraq itself. It is also a blow right to the heart of the global terrorism that threatens destruction not just in Iraq but in Britain and virtually every major country around the world."

President Bush also spoke of the incident, saying he mourns the British and American military personnel who died on Sunday.
