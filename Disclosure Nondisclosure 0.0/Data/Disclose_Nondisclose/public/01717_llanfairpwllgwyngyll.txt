Llanfairpwllgwyngyll

Llanfairpwllgwyngyll or Llanfair Pwllgwyngyll is a village on the island of Anglesey in Wales, Britain. It is in the Guinness Book of Records for being the place with the longest name in Britain. The village is also known as Llanfair PG or Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.

The name means "St Mary's church in the hollow of the white hazel near to the fierce whirlpool of St Tysilio of the red cave" in Welsh. It was invented in the 1860s by a local tailor to make the village famous for having the railway station with the longest name.

English speakers (pronounce ch as in "Loch-Ness") saying "Thlan-vire-poothl-gwin-githl-go-ger-igor-chwen-drob-oothl-landus-ilio-goh-goh-goch" will sound close to how it is meant to sound although the double L sound is difficult to recreate.

A recording of a person saying the name properly can be heard by listening to this sound file on the village website.
A common phrase used when people see the sign for this wonderful town is 'Holy Hell look at all those vowels.'
