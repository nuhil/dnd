Scotland loses to India in one-day international cricket match

India defeated Scotland by seven wickets in a One-Day International at Titwood, Glasgow, Scotland.

Scotland were reduced to 49-4 after losing the opening batsmen cheaply followed by the loss of Watson and Haq in quick succession. However a rain delay shortened the Scotland innings to 46 overs. Scottish batsmen Gavin Hamilton and Neil McCallum shared a partnership of 82 runs and Craig Wright hit 37 off 34 balls to help Scotland to 203-9 after 46 overs.

India comfortably reached the revised Duckworth-Lewis target of 209 runs from 46 overs despite some good initial fielding from Scotland and the loss of three wickets. Robin Uthappa scored a half century while Gautam Gambhir scored 85 runs. India won the match by seven wickets with 37 balls to spare.

India will play a seven-match tour of England later this month, having already won the Test series earlier this week.

An associate member of the ICC, Scotland missed a chance to play against a full member country in July when a match against Pakistan was .
