Further arrest made in connection with shooting of Rhys Jones

A third teenager, a male aged 16, has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of Rhys Jones two days ago in the Croxteth area of Liverpool. This most recent development follows the arrest and bailing of two teenagers on suspicion of murder yesterday. All those arrested so far have been local.

Merseyside Police have also today released more information about the killing. An abandoned bicycle has been found in an area "with a different postcode to the shooting", which is now being investigated. Officers also confirmed descriptions of the killer's firearm, with a police source saying: "The murder weapon is described variously by witnesses as a black handgun with a long barrel." The source went on to state that they "don't know what the motive was", stressing that "inquiries are ongoing and further arrests possible" and that the investigation is "at a very early stage".

Earlier in the day, there had been further calls for people with information surrounding the incident to come forward, including messages from Phil Neville and David Moyes, captain and manager of Everton F.C., the football club that Rhys supported. There will also be a minute's silence in memory of Rhys held ahead of Everton's game against Blackburn on Saturday, and players from both teams will wear black armbands.

The police have said they were disappointed with the current response from the public to appeals to identify the killer. Assistant Chief Constable Patricia Gallan said: "We need to get this killer off the street. Within this community people know who is responsible for this crime." She added, in a message aimed at the killer: "If you are responsible for this crime, come and tell us and hand yourself in." Merseyside Police have guaranteed the protection and anonymity of any witness who comes forward.
