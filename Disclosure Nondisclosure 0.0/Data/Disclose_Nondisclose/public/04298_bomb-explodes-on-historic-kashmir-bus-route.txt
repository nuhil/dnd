Bomb explodes on historic Kashmir bus route

April 6, 2005 

A bomb, injuring three people, exploded on a new bus service route 
between the Indian and Pakistani sides of the Kashmir border. Two other bombs on the route were found and defused. A replacement bus is scheduled for an inaugural run this Thursday.

Threats of violence against passengers, and attacks on the bus on the
inaugural trip, were issued by Muslim militants.

The bombs were found on a section of highway between Srinigar, in Indian-controlled
Kashmir, and Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. The defused explosives weighed more than 60 kilograms each.

No civilians have traveled this route since 1947, when
India and Pakistan won independence from
Britain. The Kashmir territory has been under dispute by India and
Pakistan since that time, with China joining the dispute in 1962 when
it took control of a region along the eastern border.

The bus link is seen as a major step toward healing the hostilities
between India and Pakistan by allowing families, separated for decades
during the dispute, to re-unite.

Since 1989, a handful of Islamic militant groups have fought for
Kashmir to become independent or to merge with predominantly Muslim
Pakistan. With the bus route opening coming on the top of
other so-called "confidence-building" moves between Pakistan and
India, the militants apparently feel their movement is under threat.

Bharat Karnad, an analyst with New Delhi think-tank Center for Policy
Research, stated: "Once people get their free access and they can
freely move from one territory to another, meet the families and so
on, the great incentive and motivation is gone to risk their lives to
fight for some notion of jihad that some groups may propound."

Most of the 24 passengers expected to take the maiden voyage,
officials say, are in protective custody because of threats made by
some of the militant groups against them and their families.
