Home video captures alleged UFOs in Haiti

A video has surfaced on the website "LiveLeak.com" that shows what appears to be more than a dozen Unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in a Haitian neighborhood.

The video was reportedly filmed on August 6 and was uploaded to "LiveLeak" on August 10, then hosted on "YouTube.com". It is not known who filmed the alleged UFOs. "Wikinews" has attempted to contact the uploader of the video by e-mail, but has not yet received a response.

The beginning of the video appears to show two large UFOs flying over a woman who is taping the objects with a video camera. The objects, shaped like flowers when viewed from the ground, make a faint roaring noise as they pass over. They continue to fly towards a mountain range where they fly in formation to meet up with what look likes to be more than 12 other UFOs. The video then stops. 

One website is dubbing the video as a fake, saying that it's using Computer-generated imagery (CGI). One image on the website "AboveTopSecret.com" claims that the images of palm trees in one snapshot of the video are multiple copies of a single template. Another examination apparently shows that the UFOs are pasted in over the video.
