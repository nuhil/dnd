South African cricket team in Zimbabwe 2007 - 3rd ODI

South Africa have recorded a 3-0 series whitewash over Zimbabwe with victory in the final One-Day International of the series at Harare Sports Club, Harare, Zimbabwe.

Having chosen to bat first, South Africa lost both opening batsmen relatively early. Albie Morkel and Abraham de Villiers shared a massive partnership of 186 runs, with Morkel falling just short of a century when he was caught behind at 97 and de Villiers scoring 107 in 89 balls. Other South African batsmen were dismissed cheaply, with Zimbabwean bowler Gary Brent taking three wickets, but South Africa reached 323-9 after fifty overs. 

The Zimbabwean opening batsmen, Vusi Sibanda and Hamilton Masakadza, scored 41 and 48 runs respectively in a bright start for Zimbabwe. Brendan Taylor added 43 runs, and shared a partnership of 109 with Tatenda Taibu. Taibu went on to score his first ever one-day century, finishing on 107 not out. However it was not enough to boost Zimbabwe's run chase and they finished on 295-7, 28 runs short of South Africa's total.
