Third case of BSE reported in Canada

Another confirmed case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or "mad cow disease") was reported today to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). The infected cow was found in the province of Alberta, where two previous cases of BSE have been reported in the past year. The cow itself was born in March of 1998, mere months after a ban placed by the CFIA to stop the use of any feed which might contain any "specified risk material"-- material that is known to carry the BSE agent. The cow's origin is still unknown.

The CFIA is now in control of the carcass and makes clear that no part of the cow has entered the food supply.

A team of experts from the United States have been sent to re-evaluate the situation and to make recommendations about reopening the U.S. border. The border was closed to beef exports after the first incident of BSE was reported in Canada. The closure continues to cause major problems for Canadian beef farmers who depended on the United States beef market.
