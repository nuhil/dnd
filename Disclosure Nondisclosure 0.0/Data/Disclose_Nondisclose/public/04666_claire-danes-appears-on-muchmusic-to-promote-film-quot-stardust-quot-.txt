Actress Claire Danes appeared Wednesday in Toronto on the television series "MuchOnDemand", to promote her new film, "Stardust".

Danes appears in the fantasy epic "Stardust" opposite Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert DeNiro, and Sienna Miller. The film is based on Neil Gaiman's novel of the same name. Danes plays a striking girl named Yvaine, who is a fallen star. Pfeiffer, DeNiro, and Charlie Cox are all pursuing her.

She began stepping back into the spotlight a few years ago, with lead roles in "The Hours", "Stage Beauty", "Shopgirl", and "The Family Stone".

This September, Danes will hit Broadway for the first time, as Eliza Doolittle in a revival of "Pygmalion", also known as "My Fair Lady". She will soon be seen in another film, "The Flock", opposite Richard Gere".
