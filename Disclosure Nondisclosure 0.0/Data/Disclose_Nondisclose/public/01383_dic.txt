DiC

DiC Entertainment (DiC) was an international/Canadian-American movie and television production company founded in 1971 as D.i.C. Audiovisuel by Jean Chalopin in France. In 2008 Cookie Jar Group bought out DiC and then merged it with Cookie Jar Entertainment. Dic Entertainment is now owned by DHX Media. In the 1985-1988 DiC theme, the 7th Yamaha DX7 internal factory patch "Marimba" or 7th Yamaha DX7 internal factory patch "Marimba" mixed with the synth noise/noise/Fairlight CMI III (1984-1989) patch "Choir" that is similar to the Roland D-50 synth noise/Roland D-50 noise.

Its American arm was started in 1982 as DiC Enterprises. The company's United States headquarters were in Burbank, California.

In 1986, Andy Heyward bought the company, making the US headquarters the main base of operations.

In 1993, DiC Animation City (as it was then known) and Capital Cities/ABC formed DIC Entertainment LP and in 1995 it became a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company.

In 2000 with an investment by Bain Capital, Heyward re-purchased DiC Enterprises (as it was then known). He purchased Bain Capital's part in 2004.

In 2003 DiC started a syndicated children's programming block called DiC Kids Network.

In early 2006, DiC Entertainment and CBS Corporation signed a multi-year deal for a new 3-hour long programming block for Saturday mornings on CBS. The resulting "KOL Secret Slumber Party on CBS" was started the following fall.

In April 2007, DiC Entertainment, Corus Entertainment's Nelvana and Sparrowhawk Media Group announced plans to start KidsCo, a new international children's entertainment network.

On June 20, 2008, it was announced that DiC would be bought out by Cookie Jar Group. On July 23, 2008, Cookie Jar completed the buy out of DiC Entertainment, and then it was merged with Cookie Jar Entertainment.
