Inspectors close Chicago landmark Healthy Food restaurant after finding dead mouse in cooler

Chicago city inspectors closed the landmark Lithuanian restaurant Healthy Food on Thursday, after finding mouse feces on the meat slicer and cutting board, and a dead mouse in the cooler.

The restaurant has operated at 3236 S. Halsted, on the south side of the city in the Bridgeport neighborhood, since the 1930s.

"Wikinews" reporter placed a call to the restaurant to inquire if they were open. The call was answered by a woman who said, "No, we're closed. There's some technical difficulties. I'm sorry. Thank you for calling." A second phone could be heard ringing in the background.

Streets and Sanitation spokesman Matt Smith told the "Chicago Sun-Times", "To reopen, they're going to have to present us with a revamped game plan for not only rodent control but also housekeeping, they'll have to make all the corrections that our inspectors point out," he continued, "and pass a very stringent follow-up inspection."

Patrons have praised the restaurant's sauerkraut soup and other dishes over the years. Before it was closed, the restaurant had a lot of traffic from the nearby Cook County Circuit Court. The restaurant was once voted "Best Ethnic Eastern European Restaurant in Chicago", according to "New City".
