U.S. Senators call for Idaho Senator Larry Craig to resign

Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, Republican Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota, and Republican Representative Peter Hoekstra of Michigan are all calling for the resignation of Republican Senator Larry Craig of Idaho.

Senator McCain said, "My opinion is that when you plead guilty to a crime, you shouldn't serve. That's not a moral stand. That's not a holier-than-thou. It's just a factual situation." And Senator Coleman said, "Senator Craig pled guilty to a crime involving conduct unbecoming a senator. He should resign."

Craig has agreed to a temporary leadership reassignment according to a statement from the Senate's Republican Leadership saying, "Senator Larry Craig has agreed to comply with Leadership’s request that he temporarily step down as the top Republican on the Veteran Affairs Committee, Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior, and Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests. This is not a decision we take lightly but we believe this is in the best interest of the Senate until this situation is resolved by the Ethics Committee."

Craig plead guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct after allegedly trying to initiate in a sexual experience with a male undercover law enforcement officer in a Minneapolis airport.

Meanwhile, Craig said, "I did nothing wrong." Craig also said he plead guilty to a lesser charge in an effort to keep his arrest as quiet as possible. Craig said, "While I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct at the Minneapolis airport or anywhere else, I chose to plead guilty to a lesser charge in hopes of making it go away...It's clear, though, that through my actions I have brought a cloud over Idaho. For that, I ask the people of Idaho for their forgiveness... I am not gay. I never have been gay" 

Craig, 62, is in the middle of his third term and is seeking re-election next year.
