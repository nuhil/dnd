Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen

Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Fuller Olsen (born June 13, 1986) are twin American actresses who have been seen in movies and on television series since they were nine months old.

The twins began acting on the ABC series "Full House", a success between 1987 and 1995, in which both of them played Michelle Tanner.

In the early 1990s, they became the youngest entrepreneurs in Hollywood history by forming Dualstar Entertainment.

Later that decade, they were seen on "Two of a Kind" and "So Little Time", as well as their own animated series.

Movie credits of theirs include "It Takes Two" (1994), "New York Minute" (2003), and countless direct-to-video movies and specials.

In 2004, the Olsen twins said that they would be going to university.

Merchandise related to the Olsens is still very popular in the teenage market. The Olsens have a clothing line for girls ages 4-14 in Wal-Mart stores across North America, as well as a beauty line called "Mary-Kate and Ashley: Real fashion for real girls".

In mid-2004, Mary-Kate Olsen announced she had entered treatment for an eating disorder, anorexia nervosa. A Got Milk? ad featuring the twins was pulled following the announcement. On November 20, 2007 she was hospitalized for a reported kidney infection.

The twins have bought up a number of fashion labels, and this is now their main activity. In 2012 the girls decided to quit acting permanently and focus on fashion.
