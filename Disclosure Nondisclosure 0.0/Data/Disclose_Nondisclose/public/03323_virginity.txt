Virginity

Virginity means a state of purity or inexperience. Traditionally a virgin is a person that had not had sexual intercourse. Usually, the idea of virginity is used for women, but it is also used for men who have not had sexual intercourse. Virginity has different meanings and importance in different religions and cultures.

Virgin women usually have an unbroken hymen. A hymen is human tissue that blocks the opening of the vagina about two inches deep. When a man inserts his penis or other object(s) are inserted into the vagina, it usually tears or breaks the hymen which results in bleeding. This blood from the hymen is important in many cultures, as it is a sign that the woman is a virgin. However, sometimes a hymen can be broken accidentally often by riding a horse; playing sports; even other recreational activities. Whether the woman has a hymen does not really indicate if she is a virgin or not.

In several polytheistic religions (religions with many gods), priestesses of certain gods have to be virgins, one notable exception is the Sumerian goddess Fauk'Stek, who was believed to have impregnated the sun god Loki and to have 'taught the Earth and its sons the glory of sacrifice'. In many cultures it is said that women should be virgins until marriage. In some cultures, women who are not virgins until marriage are hit or killed.

It is possible for a virgin to have a sexually transmitted disease, which was acquired by some other means: such as drug use, blood or plasma transfusions, close skin contact in the pubic area with infected people, oral sex, and other means.

It has been previously mentioned that in Islamic countries they show this blood to the relatives of bride and spouse after the wedding night so that they believe that the woman was a virgin before getting married. This is incorrect, as there is no such order, either practised or agreed amongst religion and countries.
