Indigo

Indigo is a shade of blue. The color shown at right, "electric indigo", is the closest color it is possible to display on a computer to the color of the indigo color band in the rainbow. 

Isaac Newton named and defined indigo as a spectrum color when he divided up the spectrum into the seven colors of the rainbow. The spectral range of indigo is between 450 and 420 nanometers. 

The name of the color indigo originally came from the indigo plant. Indigo is a dye made from the indigo plant, used to dye cloth. Indigo dye also is used to dye denim cloth, which is used to make what are called blue jeans (they should really be called "indigo jeans"). This shade of indigo, called "indigo dye" (shown at left above in the picture and in the color chart below), is darker than the spectrum indigo shown above.

The indigo plant originally came from the nation of India. The Ancient Greek language word for the dye is "indikon". The Romans used the term "indicum", which passed into Italian dialect and eventually into English as the word indigo.
