Arung Samudera refloated and under tow to Brisbane

"Arung Samudera", the Indonesian naval tall ship that was recently grounded off Queensland, Australia, has been salvaged from the beach at Inskip Point and is currently being towed to Brisbane for repairs.

The 35m vessel has been stranded since last Thursday, when she was grounded whilst on her way to the APEC meeting in Sydney. The ship is expected to berth in Brisbane near the naval barracks at approximately 11 a.m. (AEST). 

The tri-masted sailing training vessel, built in New Zealand, is believed to be seaworthy, but has serious damage to her keel and rudder. After the completion of repairs, the ship is expected to continue to Sydney, although it will not reach it in time for the APEC meeting.

The ship's 18-man crew are said to be "very happy" with developments. According to the Australian Navy's Commander Forbes Peters, Indonesian officials are as pleased as the ships crew, with Peters saying "The naval attache and the first secretary to the ambassador are on site here and they cuddled Lieutenant Commander Larry Cook. They are over the moon and I'm sure the commanding officer is as well, even though he's currently at sea on his ship."
