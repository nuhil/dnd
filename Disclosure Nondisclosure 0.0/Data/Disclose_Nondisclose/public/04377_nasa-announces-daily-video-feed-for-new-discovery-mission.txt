NASA announces daily video feed for new Discovery mission

NASA has announced a special daily video feed of its two upcoming missions. One of the Space Shuttle Discovery. The coverage, which began earlier on Monday on the program, "The STS-114 Return to Flight Gallery," will air daily at 1 to 3 p.m. EDT featuring video related to the launch of the Discovery.

The second mission is Expedition 10. This will send replacement Russians to the ICC--International Space Station--crew.

Commander Sergei Krikalev and Flight Engineer and NASA Station Science Officer John Phillips, the crew of Expedition 11, are scheduled to launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, at 8:46 p.m. EDT, April 14. 

European Space Agency (ESA) Astronaut Roberto Vittori of Italy will be joining them aboard their Soyuz spacecraft. Vittori is flying to the Station for eight days of scientific research under a
commercial agreement between ESA and the Russian Federal Space Agency.

The new video feed is expected to include a rotation of video items including full length interviews with each of the orbiter Discovery’s crew members. 

The STS-114 crew includes Commander Eileen Collins, Pilot Jim Kelly, Mission Specialists Soichi Noguchi, Steve Robinson, Andy Thomas, Wendy Lawrence and Charlie Camarda. This will be the first mission flown since the Colombia accident in February 2003.

The mission will link Discovery to the International Space Station in the first of two test flights to verify new inspection and repair techniques. It will also resupply the ISS with necessities.

In addition to the NASA TV channel, the programs will air on NASA’s Internet service, http://www.nasa.gov/ntv, and be available on other uplink facilities.

Shuttle Discovery has a possible launch window from May 15 to June 3, this year.
