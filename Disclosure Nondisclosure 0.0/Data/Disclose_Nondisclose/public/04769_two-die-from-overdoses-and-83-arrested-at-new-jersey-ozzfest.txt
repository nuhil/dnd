Two die from overdoses and 83 arrested at New Jersey Ozzfest

Two men died and 83 were arrested at the New Jersey PNC Arts center, Holmdel the scene of this year's New Jersey Ozzfest, an annual travelling hard rock and heavy metal show. This year's Ozzfest includes Lordi, Static-X, Lamb of God and the show's namesake, Ozzy Osbourne.

Raymond Guarino, 26, of Forked River, New Jersey collapsed at around 3:15 p.m. and went into cardiac arrest, following which he was resuscitated. He later died in a local hospital. It is believed his death was the result of his consumption of cocaine, marijuana and alcohol. An autopsy will be conducted to confirm the cause of death.

Patrick Norris, 24 of Coram collapsed around 10:00 p.m. and was transported to the same hospital in cardiac arrest; he was pronounced dead on arrival. Police believe he too had consumed a combination of cocaine, marijuana and alcohol.

In addition, New Jersey police arrested 83 people on various drugs and alcohol charges, including underage drinking, as well as charges of drug possession, assault, resisting arrest, defiant trespass and lewd behavior. The arrests are the result of a crackdown started after 13 youths were hospitalised at the venue, the youngest being 11 years-old. The crowd at today's event was too large for the 17,000 seat venue to accommodate, due mainly to the decision to make Ozzfest a free event this year.

The New Jersey Turnpike Authority, who owns the venue, has imposed a permanent ban on consuming alcohol in the car park of the site. Previously, patrons had been allowed to bring their own alcohol and consume it there.

Police arrested over 90 people on Saturday at an O.A.R concert, and 54 on Friday during an Incubus show. A Velvet Revolver concert is scheduled for later tonight. Over 300 people have been arrested at the site this week.
