Hollywood is a district in Los Angeles, California. It is famous around the world as a place where movies and television series are made. It has many different attractions such as the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Universal Studios and the famous Hollywood Sign. Many tourists come to Hollywood to see all of these things. Because of the importance of Hollywood in the movie industry of the United States, the whole industry is often called "Hollywood", even though not all movies are made in Hollywood. This use of the word "Hollywood" is called metonymy.

Many historic Hollywood theatres are used as venues and concert stages to premiere major theatrical releases (Hauptkinostarts) and host the Academy Awards.

On the mountain overlooking Hollywood, there is a sign that is made of very big letters, spelling out its name. It´s called the "Hollywood sign". The huge Hollywood sign was built in 1923.
