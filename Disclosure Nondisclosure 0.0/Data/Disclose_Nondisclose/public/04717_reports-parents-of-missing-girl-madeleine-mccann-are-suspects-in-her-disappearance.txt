Reports: Parents of missing girl Madeleine McCann are suspects in her disappearance

The parents of the missing girl Madeleine McCann from the United Kingdom are now reported to be the main suspects in her disappearance and death after the finding of blood samples from a "deceased person" were found in the vacation apartment where Madeleine was staying, the night she was reported to have disappeared from the Praia da Luz resort on May 3.

The "Diario de Noticias", a Portuguese newspaper, says that Madeleine died "accidentally" inside her parent's apartment while asleep and that she was sleeping with her brothers. It is also reported that someone had attempted to clean up the blood stains inside the apartment.

Traces of "almost invisible" blood were discovered by police dogs and detectives using ultraviolet lights. Police are attempting to run a DNA analysis on the blood, but have not confirmed or denied that the blood is Madeleine's.

The newspaper also states that authorities are asking for some family members and friends close to Madeleine to come back to Portugal and be interviewed by police.

Despite the newspaper's claims, Madeleine's parents, Gerry and Kate McCann denied all reports and accusations that they were suspects in Madeleine's disappearance. Portuguese police also deny the reports.

"The family are not suspects. This is the official position," said a spokesman for the Portuguese police, Chief Inspector Olegario Sousa.

"We're not naive, but on numerous occasions the Portuguese police have assured us they were looking for Madeleine alive and not Madeleine having been murdered. I don't know of any information that's changed that," said Mr. McCann with his wife Kate adding, "Last week when we met with the police they said, 'We are looking for a living child.' It is not us who committed the crime, but people will always criticize."
