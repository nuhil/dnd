Zimbabwe have defeated Australia by five wickets in Group B of the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship at Newlands Cricket Ground, Cape Town, South Africa.

Australia, who are the world champions in the 50 over format, struggled against some good fielding and bowling from Zimbabwe.

Brad Hodge was Australia's top scoring batsman, scoring 35 not out, while Andrew Symonds scored 33 runs before being stumped.

Zimbabwe's batsmen started well, but Vusi Sibanda was caught behind for 23, as were Justice Chibhabha, Tatenda Taibu and Stuart Matsikenyeri to leave Zimbabwe on 70-4. A heavy shower interrupted the innings, but play restarted and Brendan Taylor scored 60 not out as Zimbabwe reached the target with one ball remaining in a tense finish.
