Legia receives ban; Rovers face Vetra

Legia Warszawa have been kicked out of the 2007 UEFA Intertoto Cup and have received a one year ban in a future season. 

UEFA referee Mario Vlk of Slovakia abandoned the match at half time after hundreds of fans of Legia went onto the field and tried to pull down the goalposts and destroy advertising boardings. The fans clashed with police and threw trash onto the field. Lithuanian police used tear gas to stop the violence and made about 100 arrests.

Due to the fact that Legia has been expelled, FK Vetra automatically will face Blackburn Rovers in the third and final round. The match was awarded to FK Vetra 3-0. The 2 Leg of the tie was cancelled.

UEFA made a statement in regards to Legia's most recent hooligan problem. "Although Legia said they had done much to curb hooliganism in the past three years, the body identified an "obvious problem with Legia supporters at away matches on the continent". In reaching its decision, it added: "Legia must react quickly and firmly if the club wishes to participate in UEFA competition in future. With Legia's considerable disciplinary record for away matches, the duty of playing matches against Legia becomes a tall order that UEFA cannot afford to support any longer." 

Legia have until Saturday if they wish to appeal the ban.
