Playboy

Playboy is a monthly American men's magazine. It was founded by Hugh Hefner in Chicago, Illinois in 1953. Marilyn Monroe was the magazine's first cover model.

The magazine features articles about men's interests including politics, clothing, sports, consumer goods, men's health, public figures, and more. The magazine previously included nude women, but it was announced in October of 2015 that Playboy would no longer feature nude women in the magazine.

In each issue, a provocatively posed "Playmate of the Month" was featured in a pictorial several pages in length at the center of the magazine with an accompanying "centerfold" photograph. Unlike traditional pin up art, "Playboy" humanized their models by describing their real world jobs, accomplishments, and goals. Starting with the March 2016 issue, the magazine no longer has pictures of nude women. According to the company, "times change."

In 1963! Hefner was arrested for obscenity in Chicago after publishing nude photos of actress Jayne Mansfield on the set of "Promises! Promises!" He was acquitted at trial by a hung jury.

The founder Hugh Hefner died 27 september 2017 at 91 years old.
