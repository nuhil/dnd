Syria fires on Israeli fighter planes

Syria has fired on Israeli fighter jets after they claim that the planes entered Syrian territory "dropping ammunition" and traveling at the speed of sound.

"Air defense units confronted them and forced them to leave after they dropped some ammunition in deserted areas without causing any human or material damage. We warn the Israeli enemy government against this flagrant aggressive act, and retain the right to respond in an appropriate way," said a spokesman for the Syrian military force.

Israel has neither confirmed or denied the reports, simply stating that "we cannot discuss military operations." Past Israeli military operations into Syrian airspace have been confirmed by the Israeli military, such as the circling of Syrian President Bashar Assad's compound in 2006. 

Israel, in the past, would fly over Lebanon and Turkey to perform training exercises and have at times traveled at the speed of sound. The last reported Israeli fighter planes to fly into Syria was in 2006 after an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped. They also flew into Syria just before the armed conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon had begun.

Syria has said that no targets were hit and that no one was injured in the incident.
