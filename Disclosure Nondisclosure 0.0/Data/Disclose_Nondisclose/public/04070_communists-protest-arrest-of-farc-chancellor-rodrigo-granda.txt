Communists protest arrest of FARC chancellor Rodrigo Granda

Rodrigo Granda, also known as Ricardo Gonzalez, was arrested by Colombian forces on December 13, 2004.
The communist group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) claims the arrest is illegal, since Granda was in Venezuela for purposes related to his work as a international FARC delegate. However, the Colombia government does not recognize the FARC as a legitimate political group and accuses the FARC of terrorism and drug trafficking.

According to a note released by the FARC, several communist parties are showing solidarity with the FARC by protesting the arrest of Rodrigo Granda. In addition, they criticize the extradition of the FARC commander Simón Trinidad to the United States of America.
