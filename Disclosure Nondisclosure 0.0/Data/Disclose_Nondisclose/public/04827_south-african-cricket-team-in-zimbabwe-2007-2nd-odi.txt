South African cricket team in Zimbabwe 2007 - 2nd ODI

South Africa have beaten Zimbabwe by eight wickets in the second One-Day International of the series at Harare Sports Club, Harare, Zimbabwe.

Zimbabwe lost the toss and were put in to bat first. Despite losing opener Vusi Sibanda cheaply, Brendan Taylor and Tatenda Taibu added 44 and 43 runs respectively, followed by a partnership of 84 runs from Stuart Williams (54) and Stuart Matsikenyeri (52) to record a competitive score. Zimbabwe's innings finished after fifty overs at 247-7. Of the South African bowlers, Dale Steyn took 3-65 and Morne Morkel took 2-39.

Graeme Smith and Herschelle Gibbs shared an opening partnership of 174 runs as South Africa cruised towards the 248 run target. Smith, the South African captain, fell just short of a century when he was caught behind off the bowling of his Zimbabwean counterpart Prosper Utseya. Gibbs went on to score 110 runs from 100 balls and South Africa reached the target with just under eleven overs to spare.

South Africa have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three match series, with the final match to be played tomorrow in Harare.
