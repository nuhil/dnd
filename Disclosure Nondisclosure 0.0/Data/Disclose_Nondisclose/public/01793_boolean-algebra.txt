Boolean algebra

Boolean algebra is algebra for binary (0 means false and 1 means true). It uses normal maths symbols, but it does not work in the same way. It is named after its creator George Boole.

The NOT operator is written with a bar over numbers or letters like this:

It means the output is not the input.

The AND operator is written as formula_4 like this:

The output is true only if one and the other input is true.

The OR operator is written as formula_9 like this:

One or the other input can be true for the output to be true.

XOR basically means "exclusive or", meaning one input or the other must be true, but not both.

The XOR operator is written as formula_14 like this:

To make it more simple, one or the other input must be true, but not both.

Different gates can be put together in different orders:

It is not the same as a NOT then an AND like this: formula_20

which is called "XOR identity table"
, if
formula_23.
or if formula_24=TRUE, TRUE.,

Augustus De Morgan found out that it is possible to change a formula_9 sign to a formula_4 sign and make or break a bar. See the 2 examples below:

"Make/break the bar and change the sign."
