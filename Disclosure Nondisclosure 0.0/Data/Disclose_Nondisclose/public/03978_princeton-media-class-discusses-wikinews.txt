Princeton media class discusses Wikinews

According to Ryan Walsh, editor of the websites for both the Princeton Journal of Science and American Foreign Policy, internet news service Wikinews was the topic of a report by Federico Baradello in a Princeton University course on mass media and public policy. The course, offered through the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, studies "the impact of policy on the content, presentation, influence, and technology of a rapidly-evolving 21st century news media," according to the school.

Walsh, currently a junior at Princeton, characterized the report in an to Wikinews user Pingswept as "great" and added that "everyone in the class seemed to enjoy learning about Wikinews, and Federico was a great speaker."

According to an from Baradello, the report, which took place on Monday, 21 February 2005, provided a "basic overview of its history (evolution), ownership, viewership, and position in the news market." It included a live demonstration of adding new content to Wikinews. The barebones content provided in the demonstration was developed into this article.

Baradello's report is available on the course's blog. His final course paper on the decentralization of news gathering includes a case study on Wikinews with commentary from Jimmy Wales and will be available in PDF form by late May.
