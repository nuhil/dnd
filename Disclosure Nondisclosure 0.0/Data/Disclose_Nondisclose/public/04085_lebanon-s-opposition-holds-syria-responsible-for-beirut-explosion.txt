After the car bomb explosion, which injured eleven people, a series of fake bombs were discovered throughout the neighborhood. There were also and several sonic grenades thrown at pro-Syrian Lebanese Democratic Party offices.

"We warn Syria not to let these midgets carry out security actions in the country," Reuters quotes Jumblatt as adding.
