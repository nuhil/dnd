100m record beaten in Rieti

Asafa Powell has broken the world 100 metre record at the IAAF Grand Prix Rieti. The Jamaican set the record of 9.74 seconds in one of two heats, after setting the previous record in Athens in June 2005, and meeting it twice in Gateshead and Zurich. The race took place under a strong following wind, but still within International Association of Athletics Federations standards. 

Speaking about the heat, Powell said 'It's just to remind my fans that Asafa Powell is still here. I came here and executed properly and did what I was supposed to do.' Powell was followed by Michael Frater, also Jamaican, who came second, and Norway's Jaysuma Saidy Ndure. They ran 10.03 seconds and 10.10 seconds respectively. 

Powell recently gained a bronze medal at the World Championships, after admitting he had given up during the final when he realised he was out of gold medal contention. It was a major disappointment for Powell, who has never scored a world title despite breaking the record four times.
