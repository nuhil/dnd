Ghana's first female Chief Justice receives award

The first female Chief Justice of Ghana, Georgina Theodora Wood was among 77 others who received national awards in Accra today. The awards are for distinguished services to Ghana.

Georgina Wood, who became Chief Justice on June 15, 2007, received her award from President John Kufuor. She was given the "Order of the Star of Ghana", the nation's highest award. Two others who received this award as well were Dr Paul Acquah, Governor of the Bank of Ghana and the Omanhene (King) of the Juaben Traditional Area, Nana Otuo Serebour II, a former head of Ghana's Statistical Service, for his contribution to industry and public service (traditional category).

President Kufuor is quoted as saying at the award ceremony that "Like the Olympic medalist, we should seek to surpass existing limits to set new records hitherto deemed unattainable. This way, Africa, including Ghana, can excel in the competition and thereby carve a dignified niche for itself in the Global Village."

As Dr. Paul Acquah received the award, the audience shouted "The value is the same" which is the catchphrase for the Ghanaian cedi redenomination in process at present. Nana Otuo Serebour did a short Adowa dance much to the admiration of the audience. The loudest ovation was however reserved for Georgina Wood as she received her award. Professor Atukwei Okai, a writer, poet and educationist, recited a poem which translates as "You are because we are".

Other awards given out were the in the Order of the Volta (Companion), Order of the Volta (Member) and the Grand Medal categories. Among the winners were Paul Victor Obeng, influential member of Jerry Rawlings' military government in the 1990s, Dr G.K. Agama, a former governor of the Bank of Ghana, Ike Quartey, former WBA welterweight champion. Some popular musicians, including Nana Kwame Ampadu, Kofi Ghanaba, Diana Akiwumi, Pat Thomas and Sidiku Buari also received honours.
