United States National Guard

The United States National Guard is a branch or organization of the United States Army and the United States Air Force. The U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force are both branches of the United States military. The National Guard is a militia for the United States (in other words, an emergency army meant to protect the United States). Each U.S. State has its own National Guard, usually under the control of that state's government. When needed, they are mobilized under control of the United States. 

There are two parts of the National Guard: The Air National Guard and The Army National Guard. The Air National Guard is part of the United States Air Force; the Army National Guard is part of the United States Army. Together, the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard are called the United States National Guard. Separately, the two National Guard groups are identified by the kinds of jobs they do. For example, the Air National Guard does mainly air defense jobs, while the Army National Guard does the jobs on the ground.
