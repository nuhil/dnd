India won the toss and captain Rahul Dravid chose to send England in to bat first. England posted a score of 281-8 after fifty overs. After a bright start from opening batsmen Alastair Cook and Matt Prior, who shared a partnership of 76 runs, England were restricted by the Indian bowlers and Kevin Pietersen was stumped by wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni for just nine runs. Paul Collingwood scored 44 runs and Ian Bell finished on 79, while R P Singh was the best performing Indian bowler with 3-55.

In response, India faltered early on when Sachin Tendulkar was dismissed for just eight runs followed by Dinesh Karthik an over later for a duck. However Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly shared a 104 run partnership, with both batsmen reaching their fifty, which was ended when Dravid was bowled by Chris Tremlett for 56. In his next over, Tremlett also removed Sourav Ganguly when he was caught behind for 72. India's run chase suffered further blows when Mahendra Singh Dhoni was dismissed for 13 and Yuvraj Singh run out for 45. India were bowled out for 239 runs, 43 runs short of the target.
