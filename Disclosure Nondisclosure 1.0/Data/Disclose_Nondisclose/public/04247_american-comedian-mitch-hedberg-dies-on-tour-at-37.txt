American comedian Mitch Hedberg dies on tour at 37

Stand-up comedian Mitch Hedberg was found dead Wednesday in his hotel room in New Jersey. The comedian, originally from the St. Paul, Minnesota region, was on an east coast tour of the USA. Hedberg started his career in South Florida, and later worked in Seattle.

While the cause of Hedberg's death is yet unconfirmed, Hedberg's performance at a show in Portland, Maine in October 2004 suggested he might have a problem with drug use. According to Steve Kolowich of the "Bowdoin Orient", "Hedberg, who was clearly intoxicated, was falling down all over the stage that night. At one point, he lay down behind the back curtain and told jokes for approximately ten minutes before rolling back into sight. He also asked the audience where the best bar in town was, and invited them to join him there after the show."

According to an "AP" report on KLTV.com, Hedberg's mother, Mary Hedberg, claimed speculation that her son's death was drug-related was "gossip." The same report notes that services will be held in Woodbury, Minnesota on Tuesday, April 5.

Hedberg, a frequent guest on Late Night with David Letterman, had released two CDs titled "Strategic Grill Locations" and" Mitch All Together". He also directed a movie, "Los Enchiladas!" The movie premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.
