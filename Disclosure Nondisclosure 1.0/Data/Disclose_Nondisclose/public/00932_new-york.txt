New York

New York is one of the 50 states of the United States of America. It was one of the first thirteen states. It is well known for having the city of the same name, "New York City", in the southeastern part of the state.

New York is in the northeastern United States, bordered by Lake Ontario and Canada on the north, Lake Erie and Canada on the west, Pennsylvania on the west and south, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut on the east, and New Jersey on the south and west of New York City.

New York also has Long Island, a large island in the Atlantic Ocean. Parts of New York City (Queens and Brooklyn) are on Long Island. The majority of people in the state live in the New York metropolitan area. The larger part of New York, north and northwest of the metropolitan area, is called "Upstate New York". Upstate cities include Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and the state capital Albany. These places became cities because of the Erie Canal. New York City is the largest city in the state. Buffalo, New York is second. Albany is the capital. Between 1788 and 1797, the Legislature moved the state capital around between Albany, Kingston, Poughkeepsie, and New York City. Albany became the permanent capital from 1797.

New York was originally New Netherland, started by the Dutch Empire in the early 17th century. Late in the century, it surrendered to an English fleet during the Anglo-Dutch Wars and became part of the British Empire. About half the Dutch colony was given to neighboring English colonies. The Battle of Long Island, Battle of Saratoga, and other important battles of the American Revolution were fought in New York and it joined the new United States. 

The United States Census Bureau says that, as of 2005, New York had the third most people (population) in the United States, after California and Texas. New York's estimated population is 19,297,729.
