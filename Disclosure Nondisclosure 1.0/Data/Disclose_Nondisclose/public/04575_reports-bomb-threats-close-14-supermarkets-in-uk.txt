Reports: Bomb threats close 14 supermarkets in UK

Authorities have closed at least 14 Tesco supermarkets located in Lancashire, Suffolk, Dyfed Powys, Fife, Leicestershire, Humberside, West Mercia, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Strathclyde and London in the United Kingdom after receiving a security alert. 

Witnesses say that authorities received a bomb threat and that the stores' car parks have been blocked off by police. 

"Police came and told us it had received a bomb threat. They suggested we may want to close, but our manager has kept us open," said an unnamed worker at a shop near a Tesco in Barrhead, East Renfrewshire.

"Police are investigating a series of incidents in a number of locations across the country involving Tesco stores. Tesco is working with the police following a series of incidents. These stores have been temporarily closed as a precaution for public safety," said a police officer with the Hertfordshire police department. The police are treating their enquiries as a "criminal investigation."

It is not known why the shops were closed, but authorities have stated that a matter of public safety caused authorities to close the stores. No injuries are reported and police say they will remain at the stores until further notice.
