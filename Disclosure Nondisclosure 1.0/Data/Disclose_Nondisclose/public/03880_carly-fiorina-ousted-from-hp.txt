Carly Fiorina ousted from HP

New York - Carly Fiorina was ousted by the board of directors of HP yesterday, much to the delight of Wall Street. Ms Fiorina's resignation was the result of a disagreement with the board over the future of the company. Often cited as America's most powerful businesswoman, Ms Fiorina presided over the multi-billion dollar merger between Hewlett Packard and Compaq Computers in 2002. 

The move comes after several months of intense speculation about her future with the company. Having promised billions in annual savings to the company from the 2002 merger, the combined company failed to keep pace with competitors such as Dell, or to deliver any significant increases in profits, particularly in the personal computer market. A recent investigation by Fortune magazine highlighted the fact that the firm's highly profitable printer business supported the lower-margin computer business. 

After the announcement, HP shares surged 10% on Wall Street against a generally poor performance by the major indices.
