Man takes armoured vehicle on rampage through Western Sydney

Police have arrested and charged a 45-year-old man from Dharruk in Western Sydney after he went on a 90 minute rampage throughout Western Sydney in an armoured personnel carrier. It is believed that the APC was privately-owned and was recently restored.

The man gained attention of the police shortly after 2 a.m. AEST when he was spotted destroying an electricity substation in Minchinbury. The man then led police on a rampage through Mt Druitt, Dharruk, Emerton, Glendenning and Plumpton where he brought down six mobile phone towers and relay sheds.

The rampage ended in Dean Park after the APC stalled as it was being driven towards another mobile phone tower. Police moved in and arrested the vehicle's driver.

Chief Inspector Guy Haberly from Mount Druitt Police said the man destroyed mobile phone towers by "crashing through the perimeter fence and colliding with structures causing significant damage".

The man was reportedly charged with breaking, entering and stealing; predatory driving; six counts of malicious damage; possession of a prohibited drug; use of a weapon to avoid apprehension and driving in a dangerous manner. Police refused the man bail.
