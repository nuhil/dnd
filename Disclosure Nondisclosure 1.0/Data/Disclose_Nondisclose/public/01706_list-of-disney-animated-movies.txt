List of Disney animated movies

Below is a list of animated movies from Walt Disney Pictures/The Walt Disney Company. For a list of live-action movies from the company, see List of Disney movies.

The following is a list of the fifty-eight movies which are said to be the Walt Disney Feature Animation (WDFA) canon. They are also known as the Walt Disney Animated Classics. The canon includes animated movies that were or are being produced entirely by WDFA. Movies which are not part of the canon are movies which include both animation and live-action, spin-offs from Disney television programs, the direct-to-video movies produced by the DisneyToons studio in Australia (some of which received theatrical releases), or the Pixar movies (which Disney "presents" but does not produce). WDFA once announced that "Home on the Range" (released April 2, 2004) would be its final traditionally animated movie. They also said that from "Chicken Little" (released November 4, 2005) onwards, all future WDFA movies will be computer animated. However, this changed in July 2006 when a new traditionally animated movie, "The Princess and the Frog", was revealed to be in development.

The above US list varies slightly with the UK version. Whilst the US list has Dinosaur at #39 and Winnie the Pooh at #51, these don't feature in the UK list, which instead features The Wild at #46. The UK list is as follows:
These movies use Live-action with animation. They are not considered a part of the official canon.
