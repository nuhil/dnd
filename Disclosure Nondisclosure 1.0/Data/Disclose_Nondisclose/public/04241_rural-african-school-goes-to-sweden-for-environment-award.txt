Rural African school goes to Sweden for environment award

Emwatsi Primary School in western Kenya has been selected as a 2005 international finalist for the Volvo Adventure Award for their project "Biodiversity Conservation through Beekeeping", which focuses on income diversification through honey production, conservation of natural vegetation and planting of bee forage trees.

It is the first time in the history of the Volvo Adventure Award that a Kenyan project has been selected as an international finalist. Emwatsi Primary School is a member of the Lake Victoria Schools Agroforestry & Environmental Education Network, which is facilitated by the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) and the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) within the framework of the 'Farmers of the Future' initiative.

Volvo Adventure was set up to recognize and reward practical environmental action being taken by young people in their local community. It is open to young people around the world aged between 10 and 16 years, working with schools and youth and community groups. Volvo Adventure is supported by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

15 projects from all over the world have been selected by a jury of international experts out of hundreds of applications. Five pupils and two teachers of Emwatsi Primary School will take off to Sweden in May to participate in the Volvo Adventure Conference and present their innovative project and practical action. The project will also be showcased to the world on the Volvo Adventure website and will contribute to an international handbook of practical environmental action.
