New Zealand Labour Party announces 'early election' list

The New Zealand Labour Party announced its party list admidst speculations it may call an early election. The election must be held before Sept 24 2005. The list ranking is often seen as a ranking of the importance for each politician to the party. 

Hon. Parekura Horomia was ranked at number five, the highest ranking of any Maori MP. The Maori MPs face a strong challenge from the newly formed Maori Party. Shane Jones, the highest placed non-MP, is all but assured of a seat in the next Parliament. Steven Ching is placed at 42, and represents Labour's interest in courting the Asian vote. The Asian population has grown significantly over the past ten years within New Zealand. 

The surprising absentee is Hon. George Hawkins, the Minister of Police. He has been criticised for performing poorly in the House, and it is speculated he was offered a low ranking and refused. He is likely to return to Parliament on the basis of his strong hold on the Manurewa electorate seat.

At the time, no other major political party has released its list.
New Zealand changed its electoral system to MMP in 1996, before then it used FPP. In the 2002 election, Labour won 52 seats. Labour then became government in a minority coalition. Elections are held every three years in New Zealand.
