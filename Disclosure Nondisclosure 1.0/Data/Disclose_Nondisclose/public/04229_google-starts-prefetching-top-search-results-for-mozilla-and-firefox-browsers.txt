Google starts prefetching top search results for Mozilla and Firefox browsers

Google engineer Reza Behforooz announced in a Google blog entry on March 30 that search engine Google has enabled ""link prefetching"" for some of their search results. The "link prefetching" has not been standardized, but it can enable faster page loading of Google search results in Mozilla and Firefox browsers that have the feature enabled.

When Google determines a user has a high likelihood of clicking on a search result, Google inserts a tag into the results they send out in response to a search. Some browsers can then preload that page, so in the event the user does select the page, it loads very quickly.

For example, a Google search for "wikipedia" today by yielded an HTML page with this code included:
codice_1
While not a formal benchmark, in casual testing by , Firefox 1.0.2 loaded the Wikipedia main page in about half the time when the page had been "link prefetched", as opposed to when it had not been. The load times were approximately 1.5 seconds and 3 seconds respectively. Internet Explorer 6.0 loaded the same page in slightly less than 3 seconds.

Users who want to disable prefetching in Firefox can do the following:
