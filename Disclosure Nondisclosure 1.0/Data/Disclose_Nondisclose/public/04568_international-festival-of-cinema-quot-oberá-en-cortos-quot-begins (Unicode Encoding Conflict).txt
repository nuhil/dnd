International Festival of Cinema &quot;Oberá en cortos&quot; begins

After the success obtained last year, the second edition of the International Festival of Cinema "Oberá en Cortos" began at Oberá's theatre last Tuesday 10th. Local and provincial authorities and the vice rector of the National University of Misiones, Aldo Montini, were present at the inaugural ceremony.

"This festival is earning a place, not only in the province, but in the region as an important event for the Regional Cultural Association Argentina - Paraguay" said Jorge Betaglio, secretary of tourism of the Misiones province.

"Oberá en Cortos" is an international competition for short format films and video. It takes place between the 10th and 15th of July of this year. The movies will be shown for six days in the Oberá's theatre, the "Ex-secadero Barbaro", the San Martín square and the "Parque de las Naciones". In addition, different mobile cinemas will cross the province, to show the movies in more than fifteen municipalities to people who cannot come to the city of Oberá.

"This is an area we still have to keep on building, that has to do with working on the production of cultural sense and reflecting our identities," said Axel Monsú, one of the organizers of the event.

The first night, the "Murga del Monte", a group of filmmakers made up of the community members, was there to show "No lejos del Río de la Plata". This is a movie, filmed in the centre of Misiones in 1991, that reports the life of the Swedish immigrants upon their arrival to these lands.

The festival is organized by the "Productora de la Tierra", a cooperative of communication and is supported by the Subsecretary of Tourism of Misiones. In addition, different workshops are carried out in two facilities of the city.
