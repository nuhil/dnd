Scholarships awarded to isolated pacific islanders in Micronesia

The Habele Outer Island Education announced Tuesday that it will be awarding over US$3,500 in tuition assistance scholarships to students from the Outer Islands of Yap State, in the Federated States of Micronesia.

The fund is a South Carolina based 501(c)3 nonprofit corporation, administered by unpaid volunteers, including many returned Peace Corps Volunteers who have served time in Micronesia's public schools.

The scholarships were awarded to two female high school students from the Atoll of Ulithi. These students will be traveling to the neighboring Republic of Palau to attend classes at the private all-girls Bethanaia High School.

Habele was incorporated in 2006, and began informal scholarships three years earlier in 2003. In addition to providing scholarships to students who attend private schools, the organization also gathers and distributes donations of school supplies to the public schools in the Outer Islands of Yap.
