US Chief Justice John Roberts hospitalized

Chief Justice John Roberts was hospitalized after having a seizure in his summer home in Maine. A statement released by Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg stated that Justice Roberts took a minor fall from the seizure, and has been transported to the Penobscot Bay Medical Center. In addition, she said that Justice Roberts has undergone a, "thorough neurological evaluation, which revealed no cause for concern." 

Justice Roberts, 52, had a similar incident in 1993, when he suffered a "isolated, idiosyncratic seizure," according to White House doctors. 

The Justice was returning from a boat ride at around 2 p.m. EDT (UTC-4) Monday when he fell on a dock near his home in Port Clyde on Maine's Hupper Island, Arberg said. He was taken by boat to the mainland, and transferred to an ambulance, said St. George Fire Chief Tim Polky. Doctors have determined that this incident was caused by "a benign idiopathic seizure." Both descriptions, according to Arberg, hint that doctors could not determine the cause of the seizures, or link them to any known condition.
