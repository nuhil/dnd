WMAQ reporter Amy Jacobson leaves job following controversial video

WMAQ-TV NBC 5 Chicago announced yesterday that reporter Amy Jacobson was leaving her job after being videotaped in a bikini with her two sons at the home of Craig Stebic. Jacobson has been covering the story of Stebic's wife Lisa, who has been missing since April 30. 

Jacobson says that she took her children on a social visit on her day off, following an invitation from Stebic's family.

Jacobson has reported at WMAQ for the last ten years. 

The video of her at Craig Stebic's home was either taken by or given to CBS 2 WBBM-TV Chicago, the CBS affiliate. The entire six minute video of Jacobson is available at cbs2chicago.com. 

The WMAQ President and General Manager Larry Wert stated "Amy has been one of our most valued reporters for over ten years The decision to part ways has been a difficult one. We wish her the very best."

Speaking with WGN Radio on Wednesday morning, Jacobson described WBBM-TV's releasing of the video a "cheap shot". 

She told Spike O'Dell that she is sickened by the entire ordeal and may pursue legal action against the people who took the video of her at Craig Stebic's house. Jacobson said her attorney told her it is illegal to videotape people on private property and she said she "is looking at all of her legal options." 

A press release was sent to the WMAQ-TV Newsroom staff on July 10, 2007.

Jacobson came to WMAQ-TV in 1996 from Fox affiliate WJBK located in Detroit. Jacobson is a native of Mount Prospect. She began her career at KSAX and also worked in El Paso and Tucson, AZ. She started at WMAQ as a freelance reporter and moved up to general assignment reporter. She and her husband have two children and live on the north side of Chicago.
