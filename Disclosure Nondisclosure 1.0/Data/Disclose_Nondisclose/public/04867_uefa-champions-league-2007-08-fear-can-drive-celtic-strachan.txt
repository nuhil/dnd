UEFA Champions League 2007/08: Fear can drive Celtic - Strachan

Celtic manager Gordon Strachan says the 5-0 thrashing of Hearts will make no difference to the Champions League second-leg tie against Spartak Moscow.

"If we were playing a bad side then you could say everything was going for us, but we are facing a right good side," he said about Wednesday's tie. It's good that everybody knows what good players they are and know that the task in front of us is not easy. When I played, I always had a fear of the opposition that kept you going."

Strachan says that fear would help Celtic be wary of Spartak and avoid any mistakes after the 1-1 draw in Moscow.

"If you don't have fear or respect, whatever you want to call it, then you have a problem. There is nothing wrong with a bit of fear now and again."

Strachan also stressed that the money that Celtic would earn if they reached the UEFA Champions League Group Stages will not weigh heavily on his players' minds.

"It is important for us to be in the Champions League. We would like to continue and enjoy the experience. But it's not for us to worry about the financial side of things. Ours is to worry about the game and we have to deal with it. The players don't think about finances or things like that."
