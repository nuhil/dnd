SpongeBob SquarePants

SpongeBob SquarePants is an American animated Nickelodeon TV show made by Stephen Hillenburg (who also worked on "Ren and Stimpy" and "Rocko's Modern Life") that started on May 1, 1999. The main character on the show is a sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea, as the theme song states. He is a fry cook who works at a restaurant called the "Krusty Krab", which is run by a crab whose name is Eugene H. Krabs.

The show features the voice of Tom Kenny as SpongeBob, the sponge in the underwater town of Bikini Bottom. Even though SpongeBob is a sea sponge, he looks more like a kitchen sponge used for cleaning dishes. His best friend is a starfish named Patrick Star. His grumpy neighbor is an octopus named Squidward Tentacles. SpongeBob and Squidward work at the Krusty Krab, a fast food restaurant that makes Krabby Patties. The recipe for the Krabby Patty is top-secret. Mr. Krabs's enemy, Sheldon Plankton, often tries to steal the recipe.

As of March 17, 2013, the series had aired 185 episodes. Episodes were recorded from December 2011 to January 2013.

A theatrical movie premiered on November 19, 2004, which marked the end of the third season. Season 9 was announced by Nickelodeon on January 3, 2011. Filming of the ninth season began in December 2011. The movie was supposed to be a final for the show but later on the show got revived.
