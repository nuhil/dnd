"Wikinews has learned that "George Takei, who played "Sulu" on the American television show "Star Trek", has announced on the radio talk show "Coast to Coast AM With George Noory" on Monday night that a "press conference" will be held on Thursday July 26 regarding the new "Star Trek 11" movie. The movie is planned to be released in December 2008.

"I understand that there will be a press conference on Thursday, regarding the new "Star Trek" movie, and major casting announcements will be made then," said Takei.

Brad Altman of "www.georgetakei.com", has told "Wikinews" that the conference is scheduled to take place at the San Diego Comic Convention on July 26 from 1:00 p.m. (pacific time) until 3:30 p.m.. 

The director of the new movie, J. J. Abrams is expected to announce a "few surprises," says a statement posted on the "Comic-Con 2007" website.

The conference is apparently to put to rest rumors that started to circulate online that Matt Damon was going to star in the new movie as "Captain James T. Kirk". Damon later said in an interview with "ign.com" that he was "too old" to play the role and that it was nothing but an "internet rumor" and that he was not approached by anyone to be in the film.

It is rumored that Leonard Nimoy will be cast as "Spock," or that Zachary Quinto will play the role. 

It is also rumored that the movie will be a prequel to the TV show. According to "IMDb" the movie is going to be "set before 'The Original Series' [when] Kirk and Spock are newly graduated Cadets fresh from Starfleet Academy and are sent on their first space mission."
