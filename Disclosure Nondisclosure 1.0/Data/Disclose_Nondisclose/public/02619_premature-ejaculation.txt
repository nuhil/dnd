Premature ejaculation

Premature ejaculation (also known as PE) is a condition affecting many men. It is when during sexual intercourse (sex) the male can not stop himself from ejaculating after starting sex. 

The condition is usually curable or at least treatable by a few exercises. (There are more exercises than these, however, these are the most common.)

One exercise is to create an erection and begin to lose it, then stimulate it again. This exercise is best done alone at first and then with a partner. Thrusting should not be used with a partner until very near the end of treatment. This treatment may take several weeks to fully cure the problem if it is used properly. 

Another treatment involves using the muscle which stops urine. To locate the muscle, simply begin urinating and stop quickly before emptying the bladder. Doing that, will demonstrate how to use the muscle. Then whenever convenient use the muscle. You do not need to be urinating to use the muscle and it is suggested you are not. After a few weeks of both these treatments, the PE will become more like traditional ejaculation and after about one and a half to two and a half months, it should be absolutely normal.
