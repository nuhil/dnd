2007 World Deaf Swimming Championships Day 1: European swimmers rise up

After the Opening Ceremony at the Taipei Municipal Stadium on August 11, the 2007 World Deaf Swimming Championships kicked off on August 12 in the National College of Physical Education and Sports Aquatic Center. The event was hosted by the Taipei City Government and the Chinese Taipei Sports Association of the Deaf and organized by the Foundation of 21st Summer Deaflympics Organizing Committee.

During the Opening Ceremony, event Director and Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-pin said that this swimming championship is different from other games where people without a hearing disability can participate. The event for deaf swimmers requires participation from professional volunteers such as sign language, gaming referee, and technical staff. With this event and the upcoming 2009 Summer Deaflympics in Taipei, the city hopes to provide a good exchange platform for deaf culture.

In the first matchday, some heat events have been changed to final sections, especially in the team relay competition, because only few people or teams participated. Also, the Freestyle Finals (individual and team relay) and Breaststroke Group were delayed 15 minutes due to check-in and identity problem.

In the Women 50m Freestyle Final, Ganna Lytvynenko from Ukraine improved the women deaf swimmer 50m freestyle world record established with 27.07 seconds by herself in Greece last June with 0.01 seconds. On the other hand, Grogios Dontas from Greece was beaten by Denys Bystrevsky from Ukraine in 25.02 seconds in the Men's 50m Freestyle Final.
