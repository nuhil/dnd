Miso

Miso is a thick paste. It is similar to the Korean "doenjang". It is made by fermenting soy beans with sea salt and "kōji". Kōji is the product of fermenting rice, barley, or soybeans with a mold culture, "Kōji-kin" (Aspergillus oryzae). Often, grains such as barley or rice, and sometimes other ingredients, are added. Miso is high in protein and rich in vitamins and minerals. Miso tastes salty and, depending on the grains used and fermentation time, may also be sweet. Miso is used to make miso soup.

Miso is a very important part of Japanese food. There are different kinds of miso. "Kome miso" is made from rice and beans. "Mame miso" is made from beans. "Mugi miso" is made from barley and beans. Tyougo miso is a mix of these misos.
