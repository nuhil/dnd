Holi

Holi is one of the major festivals of Hindus. It is celebrated in South Asian countries, especially in India and Nepal. Holi is the festival of colours. The festival is celebrated for two to three days. People pour colored water on each other and cook many types of sweets and other food. Holi is celebrated in the spring season because it is welcoming spring. Hindus believe that spring is full of colours so they throw coloured water on each other. 

Holi is based on a legend about King Hiranyakashipu. `Hiranyakashyapu had a son, Prahlad. Prahlad was the greatest devotee of Lord Vishnu. Hiranyakashyap wanted to kill his son, so he called his sister, Holika. She had a magic robe. This robe had the power to save the wearer from burning in fire. Hiranyakashyap ordered his sister to sit on a burning fire along with Prahlad. He thought that his sister would not be harmed by the fire because of the magic robe and Prahlad would be burnt to death. But the result was the opposite to what the evil demon king planned.

As is believed, no one can harm the person who has God as his saviour. Thus Prahlad came out of the burning fire safely and Holika was burnt to death.The other day is celebrated with joyful colours to mark the victory of virtue and goodness over evil.

The festival is celebrated for five days. The 5th day, Rang Panchami, marks the closing day of the Holi festival.
