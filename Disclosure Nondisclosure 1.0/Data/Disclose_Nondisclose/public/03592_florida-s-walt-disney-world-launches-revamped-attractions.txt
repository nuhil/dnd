Florida's Walt Disney World launches revamped attractions

The Alien Encounter attraction at Tomorrowland in the Magic Kingdom has been revised to include Experiment 626 from the movie "Lilo & Stitch". Now called "Stitch's Great Escape!", the dog-like blue creature will lash out of its tube and terrorise the audience. The Galactic Federation's Grand Councilwoman, Captain Gantu and Agent Pleakley appear in this show, essentially a prequel to the movie.

At the Living Seas, Crush the sea turtle from the Disney/Pixar movie "Finding Nemo" will host a new exhibit called "Turtle Talk", joining smaller Nemo exhibits, a mainstay at the attraction for several months. Vegetarian shark Bruce will soon become part of a shark education exhibit.

According to publicity, the Turtle Talk show will run every 15 minutes, from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. A sign language interpreted performance will run on Fridays at 10:30 am.

Disney is holding the Stitch's Great Escape! Sweepstakes, with prizes including a five-day, four night trip for four to Walt Disney World Resort.
