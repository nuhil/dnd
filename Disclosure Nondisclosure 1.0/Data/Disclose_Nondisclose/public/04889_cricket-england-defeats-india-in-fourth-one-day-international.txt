Cricket: England defeats India in fourth one-day international

England have beaten India by three wickets in the fourth One-Day International of the series at Old Trafford, Manchester, England.

England's bowlers made early breakthroughs to restrict India to 32-3. Sourav Ganguly fell to James Anderson for nine runs, while Dinesh Karthik and Rahul Dravid were both caught behind for just four runs and one run respectively. Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh shared a 71 run partnership to steady the Indian innings. Tendulkar was dismissed for 55 runs, while Yuvraj Singh was bowled by Stuart Broad for 71. India were bowled out for 212 runs, with Stuart Broad the pick of the English bowlers, taking 4-51.

India's pace bowlers struck back immediately, with England opening batsman Alastair Cook bowled by Zaheer Khan before any runs had been scored, while Matt Prior fell to Ajit Agarkar in the fourth over. Agarkar, finishing with bowling figures of 4-60, also removed Ian Bell for 24 runs followed by the wickets of Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff to reduce England to 95-5. England captain Paul Collingwood scored 47 runs before being run out and when Owais Shah was removed for eight runs England were heading for defeat. However Ravi Bopara (43 not out) and Stuart Broad (45 not out) shared a partnership of 99 runs to salvage an unlikely victory for England with twelve balls remaining.

England lead the seven match series 3-1. The fifth match will be played at Headingley, Leeds on September 2.
