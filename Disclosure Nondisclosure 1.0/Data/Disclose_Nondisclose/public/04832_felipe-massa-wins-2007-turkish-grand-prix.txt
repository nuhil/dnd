Felipe Massa wins 2007 Turkish Grand Prix

Felipe Massa wins the 2007 FIA Formula-1 Petrol Ofisi Turkish Grand Prix at the Istanbul Racing Circuit, Istanbul, Turkey.

The two red Ferrari cars of Massa and Kimi Räikkönen, starting from the clear side of the track, grabbed the lead and maintained a constant distance to each other throughout the race. 

McLaren Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton, starting 2nd, lost his position to Kimi and stayed on his rear wing until his right front tyre suffered a puncture and he lost a couple of positions while heading to the pits.

This incident allowed his teammate Fernando Alonso to take third place on the podium, to which Lewis was heading. Fernando himself had a very poor start, losing two positions to the BMW Saubers. Still, he pushed hard on Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld and, as he mentioned himself on the post-race press conference, the race started for him after the first pit-stop, when he overtook both BMW's.

Heidfeld got 4th place. Heikki Kovalainen came 6th for Renault, finishing ahead of Williams-Toyota driver, Nico Rosberg. Kubica closed the top eight.

Lewis Hamilton remains leader of the Drivers' Championship with 84 points, closely followed by the defending World Champion Fernando Alonso, 5 points behind. Felipe Massa and Kimi Räikkönen are 10 and 11 points behind Alonso, respectively. The Constructors' Championship is now closer, McLaren with 148 points, only 11 ahead of Ferrari.
