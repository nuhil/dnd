PETA protests Burberry in White Plains, NY

Today, at 12:00 p.m. EDT (UTC-4) the Animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) staged a "naked" protest in White Plains, New York. The target of the protest was British fashion house, Burberry, and their fur practices.

Two "naked" female PETA members, wearing nothing but bikini bottoms and body paint held billboards with the slogan, "When plaid goes bad." The body paint was done in the trademarked Burberry Check plaid design.

Two other PETA members were there handing out leaflets and showing a video presentation. The painted protesters were spattered with far less fake blood than other documented PETA protests in this campaign.

PETA is protesting Burberry for the company's use of fur in its products and how it is obtained. The group has staged similar protests around the world in its ongoing "BloodyBurberry"-campaign.

The protest took place at the intersection of Westchester Avenue and Bloomingdale Road in front of the The Westchester, an upscale shopping mall owned by Simon Property Group. Burberry has a retail store in the mall.

This corner is far from the mall's entrances and sees little pedestrian traffic. However, it does see heavy traffic by motorists, before whom the protestors were in plain sight. While "Wikinews" was on the scene, police and news media were the only other pedestrians.

The police presence was significant, numbering at least two vehicles and two mounted police officers. But since there was no crowd to control, they just hung back. Media was also there in numbers. At least two television crews could be observed.

As far as "Wikinews" can tell, Burberry has yet to make any public comment about any of the "BloodyBurberry" protests.
