Criminal charges filed in Nov. 19 NBA brawl

Stephen Jackson, David Harison, Ron Artest and Anthony Johnson were all charged with one count of assault and battery. Three time NBA All-Star Jermaine O’Neal was charged with two counts of assault and battery. Each charge is a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of 3 months in jail and a fine up to $500.

Gorcyca also filed charges against seven fans. John Green, John Ackerman, William Paulson, Bryant Jackson and David Wallace were all charged with assault and battery. David Wallace is the brother of Detroit Piston star, Ben Wallace. 

John Green was charged with two counts of assault and battery. The first one for tossing the cup that started the brawl and another count for punching Artest from behind when Artest went into the stands. 

Bryant Jackson also faces a felony assault charge for throwing a chair. That is punishable by up to four years in jail, but Gorcyca said Jackson may serve more time based on his prior convictions.

Two other fans, Charlie Haddad and Alvin Shackleford, were also charged with a local ordinance that prevents fans from walking onto the floor. All seven fans have been banned from The Palace.
