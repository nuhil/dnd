Akayev willing to resign as president of Kyrgyzstan

In an interview broadcast on Russian state-run Channel One television, deposed Kyrgyz president Askar Akayev, when asked whether he was prepared to resign as president, replied, "Of course, of course - if I am given the relevant guarantees and if it is in full accordance with the current legislation."

He added that he had "the desire to help so that the newly elected president is legitimate."

While acting president and prime minister Kurmanbek Bakiyev and former acting minister of securities Felix Kulov have offered him immunity, he said he would only return if parliament offered him "personal safety guarantees."

Bakiyev warned that Akayev's return could "give rise to mass unrest."

In related news, acting minister of securities Felix Kulov has been removed from parliament on his own will, RIA Novosti reported the parliamentary press service as saying.

He was reported as saying that "The set goal has been achieved: the situation in our republic has stabilized."
