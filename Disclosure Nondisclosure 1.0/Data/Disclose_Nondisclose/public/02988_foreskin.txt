Foreskin

The foreskin is a fold of skin that covers the glans penis when the penis is uncircumcised. Most mammals have foreskin.

The outside of the foreskin is like normal skin but the inside of the foreskin is a membrane like the inside of an eyelid or mouth. The foreskin is attached to the penis by the frenulum, but it can move. Muscles made it very stretchy. The five most sensitive areas of the penis are on the foreskin.

The World Health Organization say that there are lots of uses for the foreskin, such as keeping the glans penis moist, protecting it or to make sexual intercourse feel nicer since it has so many nerves in it. The removal of the foreskin, the circumcision, reduces diseases.

However, Moses and Bailey (1998), say that "it has not been demonstrated that [the foreskin] is associated with increased male sexual pleasure."

"Circumcision" is when the foreskin is cut off. It is done to satisfy medical, religious and aesthetic views. Circumcision reduces disease, though most medical associations agree the benefits are small (see Circumcision#Policies of various national medical associations).
The foreskin can also be pierced or slit for fashion reasons.
