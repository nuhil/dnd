Australian radio personality Stan Zemanek dies aged 60

Sydney radio broadcaster Stan Zemanek died early this morning (AEST) due to a brain tumour, aged 60. Zemanek retired from radio in December last year due to ill health and a desire to spend more time with his family.

Born in Sydney on May 29, 1947, he began work as a researcher for Radio C-Fun 141 in Vancouver, Canada. He then returned to Australia and worked on the John Laws program during the 1970s.

Zemanek then returned to North America, where he covered the 1983 America's Cup. Upon returning to Australia again, he spent the 14 years prior to his retirement at Sydney station 2UE, where he was a night-time presenter.

He was often abrupt on the radio, and revelled in being controversial due to his outspoken nature - something which won him a large listening audience. He was also not afraid to confront people who rung in to discuss controversial topics, and was described by "The Sydney Morning Herald" as a "professional stirrer."

He is survived by his wife Marcella, his two daughters, and his two grandchildren.
