C++

C++ (pronounced "see plus plus") is a computer programming language based on C. It was created for writing programs for many different purposes. In the 1990s, C++ became one of the most used programming languages in the world.

The C++ programming language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the 1980s, and was originally named "C with classes". The language was planned as an improvement on the C programming language, adding features based on object-oriented programming. Step by step, a lot of advanced features were added to the language, like operator overloading, exception handling and templates.

The following text is C++ source code and it will write the words "Hello World!" on the screen when it has been compiled and is executed. This program is typically the first one a programmer writes while learning a programming language.

// This is a comment. It's for *people* to read, not computers. It's usually used to describe the program.

// Iostream is the input and output stream; which stores functions such as print etc.
// Namespace std; is the standard namespace which also stores some functions
using namespace std;

// We are now creating an important instance; the main function
int main()

This program is similar to the last, except it will add 3 + 2 and print the answer instead of "Hello World!".
using namespace std;

int main()

This program subtracts, multiplies, divides then prints the answer on the screen.

using namespace std;

int main()
