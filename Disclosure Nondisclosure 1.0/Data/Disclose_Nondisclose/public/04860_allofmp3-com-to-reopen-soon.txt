AllOfMP3.com to reopen soon

The controversial Russian music site, AllOfMP3.com, is expected to reopen after a Moscow court ruled that Denis Kvasov, owner of the site, did not break Russian copyright laws and that the site was fully legal.

Mr Kvasov argued that although no royalties had been paid to the music industry, the site did pay the 15% of its profits required by the Russian Organization for Multimedia and Digital Systems (Roms). A spokesperson from Roms said "We pay royalties to those who sign up with us and ask for them. But none of the majors, among them I mean labels like EMI and Universal, want their money."

A blog post on the website, which had been shut since July, said that "the service will be resumed in the foreseeable future", however no official date for the reopening has been announced.

The court ruling disappointed many including the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). Tim Jenkins from the IFPI said, "If it were to resume trading as it was before, it would be in clear violation of copyright laws both within and outside Russia."
