Ian Fleming

Ian Lancaster Fleming (28 May 1908 - 12 August 1964) was a British author and journalist. He was best known for writing the James Bond spy novels. He also wrote the children's book "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" in 1964.

Fleming was born in London to a wealthy family. He was educated at Eton College. He spent many years working in Britain's Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War. During this time, Fleming helped with the planning and management of two British intelligence units. This experience along with his work in journalism provided much of the background to the stories in his James Bond novels.

Fleming wrote his first James Bond novel, Casino Royale, in 1952. Because of the book's success, Fleming wrote eleven more novels and two collections of short-stories about the British secret agent. 

In total, there have been twenty-three major movies based on Fleming's famous character. The twenty-fourth movie, "Spectre", was released in October 2015.

Fleming died of a heart attack in Canterbury, Kent.
