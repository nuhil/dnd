Chlorine spill in China's Jiangsu province kills 28, injures hundreds

A tanker truck filled with 35 tons of liquid chlorine collided with another truck and crashed in China's Jiangsu province on Wednesday, leaking its load, killing at least 28 and injuring hundreds. 10,000 villagers have been evacuated from the surrounding area along the Beijing-Shanghai expressway.

The driver left the scene of the accident in Huai'an city, but later in the day turned himself over to authorities in Nanjing, the provincial capital. The driver of the other truck died on the scene.

Vice mayor Lu Changsu told China's "Xinhua" that the death toll may increase because three patients are still in critical condition. Lu said that 350 people remain hospitalized.

A cleanup crew is treating the accident site with a caustic soda. Area farmers are concerned that local farmland will be rendered infertile by the spill.

CPC Vice Premier Huang Ju asked the provincial Jiangsu government to "spare no efforts", according to "Xinhua".
