NHL: Vancouver Canucks showcase new uniform

The Vancouver Canucks, hockey team to Vancouver, British Columbia, unveiled it's new home and away uniforms today. Keeping the trade-mark Orca, the jersey has remixed the colors as well as adding a green stripe for both the home and away uniforms. This is the 5th jersey the team has gone through since 1970 when the team was founded.

The redesign has been met with some criticisms. John Carter a graphics arts instructor at a local college was quoted as calling the redesign an "utter disappointment." 

The design uses the same core colors in the original design, and on the back it also has their original jersey's hockey stick symbol. The president and CEO of the Canucks, Chris Zimmerman, recognizes this saying, "Our goal when we set out was to celebrate our heritage and to design a sweater that reflects our extraordinary city and province. "We wanted to unveil a sweater that reflects our past and our future." Zimmerman also went on to say the design represents, "who we are and the connection to the community."
