Surgery

Surgery is an operation that involves a doctor. The doctor helps his patients by taking out, changing or fixing parts of the human body. Doctors who do surgeries are called surgeons. Many surgeons are experts in certain areas; for example, a surgeon that operates on bones is called an orthopaedic surgeon.

Surgery (operations) can be very simple, like taking a tooth out. Surgery can also be very complicated, like surgery to remove a cancerous tumor.

Operating rooms have to be very clean places. The doctors and nurses go to great lengths to keep the room clean where the surgery is done. Regular cleaning of the room and its tools is done to keep everything clean and germ-free.

Everyone in the operating room must wear special clothes, hats, shoes, gowns, gloves and masks that are clean and germ free. The only people allowed in the operating rooms are the doctors and nurses as well as the patient too.

When people have operations they are normally put to sleep with anaesthesia. When the patients are asleep, they cannot feel anything.

In recent years, many patients that cannot get the required surgery in their own country, or find the costs too high, travel to another country for medical care. This is called medical tourism.
