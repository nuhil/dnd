NFL star, Michael Vick, pleads guilty to dog fighting charges

Atlanta Flacons quarterback Michael Vick plead guilty to federal charges surrounding illegal dogfighting yesterday.

Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons, told the NFL Network he is, "not really surprised" by the news of his quarterback's plea. "From a personal standpoint, he's doing the right thing...That's been my counsel to him some while ago, and publicly as well, to get this behind him as quickly as he can," Blank said. However, Blank could not talk about Vick's future as a Falcon player. Sources reported that Vick's attorneys had hoped to receive notification from that National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell's office concerning Vick's NFL future before he plead guilty. However, that reportedly never happened.

Defense attorney Billy Martin said, "After consulting with his family this weekend Michael Vick asked that I announce today that he has reached an agreement with federal prosecutors regarding the charges pending against him...Mr. Vick has agreed to enter a plea of guilty to the charges and accept full responsibility for his actions and the mistakes he has made. Michael wishes to apologize everyone who has been hurt by this matter."

Vick is scheduled to appear in a federal courtroom on August 27 in Richmond, Virginia.

The maximum term for the charges Vick plead guilty to is believed to be five years in jailtime and a $250,000 citation. However, sentencing guidelines likely would dictate less. Vick's defense attorneys did not release specific details concerning the plea agreement.
