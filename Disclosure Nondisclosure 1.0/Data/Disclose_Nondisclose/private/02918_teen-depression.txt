I've been having some problems for the last year or two that I am unsure how to categorize. I have memory loss, i.e. My favorite teacher that I'd had for two years was giving a presentation, and I looked at her and could not remember who she was. I knew I knew her, but I couldn't think of her name or where I knew her from. And another time, we were going to my uncle's house to deliver some dog food and we went and made a quick stop there. About twelve minutes later, I asked my mom when we were going to go to my uncle's house and she asked if I was joking. When I told her I wasn't, she informed me we were just there. And I got it then, but it was a few moments. I forget where I put stuff, due dates for schoolwork, etc. I also feel very numb and detatched, I have a hard time connecting emotionally, I am INCREDIBLY lethargic, sleeping ALL the time, my hair has been thinning, I have been using prescription strength deoderant and I still sweat profusely, but only under my arms. I lack ambition and constantly seem to be on autopilot. I've been diagnosed with depression and ADHD, and I have been taking medicine for both. I'm on Conerta and Welbuterine, and neither have helped me at all. I did lose forty pounds, and there was a modicum of increase in my energy, and I am now down to 164 lbs, but I am still experiencing all of the symptoms stated above. I am quite frankly worried. I've had numerous blood tests, including three thyroid tests, and one time, I was told I had the hormones of a post-menopausol woman. However, numerous follow-up tests returned nothing extraordinary, and I'm left with the question, "What do I do?" I started a low-dose estrogen supplying birth control pill, because a nurse practitioner suggested it, but it has been two months and I feel no different.
