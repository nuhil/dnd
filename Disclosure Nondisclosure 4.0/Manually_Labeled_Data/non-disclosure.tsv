0	Hotellihuone oli ullakolla , jossa ei pystynyt kvelemn suorassa
0	Huonekorkeus oli suurimmassa osassa n 1,5 m
0	Huoneestamme varastettiin rannekoru ja neuletakki
0	Lisksi Spa ei ollut hotellissa vaan n kilometrin pss toisessa hotellissa
0	Laivalaiturilta oli kilometrin matka hotelliin
0	Lidon saari on kyll hyv majoituspaikka kun vierailee Venetsiassa , mutta en suosittele tt hotellia
0	DON'T stay here unless you 're less than 2 feet tall or like sleeping with centipedes
0	Our 4th floor room was an attic with a vaulted ceiling that angles down to 3 ft
0	The bed is only accessible from one side
0	The bathtub was impractical with broken shower head
0	We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede
0	2 came from throw pillows
0	We had absolutely no problems whatsoever with this hotel and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality considering the low price
0	The breakfast buffet was delicious too
0	And to finish all this off , the staff could n't have been friendlier or more helpful
0	In terms of location , the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop , then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice
0	The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours
0	Wir buchten das Hotel fr 4 Nchte in der Woche vor Ostern
0	Der Aufenthalt war durchweg angenehm
0	Das Frhstcksbuffet war reichhaltig und frisch allerdings rate ich von dem Rhrei ab
0	Wenn etwas aufgebraucht war , wurde es umgehend aufgefllt
0	Vom Frhstcksraum aus konnte man den Blick ber die Lagune genieen
0	Die Einrichtung ist geschmackvoll und zweckmig
0	An Sauberkeit mangelte es nicht
0	Obwohl wir nicht den Anspruch stellten , wurden die Handtcher tglich gewechselt
0	Das einzige Manko war die Temperatur des Duschwassers
0	Es wechselte stndig von ziemlich kalt zu sehr hei
0	Erwhnenswert ist auch das Waschbecken
0	Der Wasserhahn ist ziemlich klein und so ber dem hervorstehenden berlauf angebracht , dass es schon schwierig ist , die Hnde darunter zu waschen
0	Der Empfang an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich
0	Leider war unser Koffer nicht mit uns angekommen
0	Die nette Empfangsdame kmmerte sich darum und hielt Kontakt mit dem Flughafen
0	Am nchsten Tag wurden wir vom Hotel aus benachrichtigt , dass unser Koffer nun da sei
0	Gleich in der Nhe des Hotels ist eine Bushaltestelle
0	Wir fuhren allerdings nie mit dem Bus , da der Weg zum Anleger fr die Wasserbusse nicht weit war
0	Das Warten auf den nchsten Bus htte mitunter lnger gedauert , als zu Fu zu dem Anleger zu gehen
0	Lovely hotel , 10 min walk to the water bus stop on lido
0	Away from the madness of Venice , but close enough to be there in less than 20 minutes
0	Das Hotel liegt auf der Insel Lido neben Venedig , direkt am Meer mit Blick auf Venedig
0	Lido kann man sehr gut mit den Booten erreichen
0	Vom Bootsanlegeplatz sind es ca
0	400 m zum Hotel an der Kste entlang
0	Den Weg mussten wir zu Fu zurcklegen , da keine Busse wegen einer Baustelle dorthin fahren
0	Das Zimmer war gemtlich eingerichtet , das Bad relativ gro und alles sehr sauber und ordentlich
0	Auch mit dem Frhstcksbffet waren wir sehr zufrieden   gute Qualitt und relativ groe Auswahl
0	Wir waren rundherum zufrieden und wrden das Hotel sofort wieder buchen
0	Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so was n't a surprise or a problem , room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day
0	Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage , bacon and scrambled eggs available , must have been put on to satisfy us Brits
0	Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice
0	We had a water taxi think luxury speed boat
0	from the airport to the hotel and back again , quite an experience , a little costly but well worth it , a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus
0	Venice was very busy during the day time , St Marks Square at night is a must , fantastic atmosphere
0	Mysigt med fina rum , bra frukost och nra bde till stranden och btterminalen
0	Hotel ist sehr gut , wir waren zum zweiten mal in diesem Hotel
0	Das Personal ist sehr freundlich
0	Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit Balkon und Blick auf die Lagune   wunderschn

0	The best feature was extremely friendly helpful staff , particularly Ms Annalucia Ms Anna who were always ready to listen help out with big smiles
0	The breakfasts were very good , with good spread and the guests were made welcome to sit and eat at leisure more important when you are with toddlers

0	This hotel is in Lido which is a better choice than staying in crowded Venice
0	The water bus is very convenient and it takes only few more stops to the main attractions in Venice
0	It was a 10 min walk to water bus , would have liked it closer
0	Located on the water on Lido island , away from the rush of Venice

0	Good breakfast and convenient location
0	Would n't return or recommend
0	Htel trs bien situ dans un coin calme loin de l'agitation frntique du centre de Venise , mais seulement quelques minutes de bateau
0	Les chambres conomiques sous toit ne sont pas trs ergonomiques cause de la pente de toit et il fait vite chaud s'il y a du soleil lorsque l'air conditionn ne fonctionne pas encore , comme lors des congs de Pques
0	La vue extrieure se limite aux velux
0	La TV n'est pas un cran plat
0	On s'attend un peu plus de luxe dans un 4 toiles , mais les prix sont contenus
0	L'accueil est irrprochable et le petit djeuner est trs correct
0	VERY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL WITH DIRECTIONS , KNOWING ALL THE RIGHT PLACES TO VISIT AND WHERE TO EAT TH BEST FOOD IN THE AREA

0	Rustige buurt
0	Walls extremely thin , you can hear everything
0	Excessive hoovering every morning outside bedroom
0	There
0	Is a bar , but no one to tend it
0	If you 're looking for a hotel where the action is , go elsewhere
0	The hotel is on the Lido , which is about a 1015 minute waterbus ride away from Venice
0	However , if you 're looking for a place on the Lido , this is a wellpriced option
0	The staff was great with handlingrecommending dinner reservations , even during an insane Carnevale weekend
0	The doors are a little thin and since the building is old , the soundproofing needs improvement
0	The quarters are cramped , but the room comes with breakfast
0	Recommended
0	Hotel facilities are good and breakfast ample
0	Friendly reception very helpful
0	Good saunas but relaxation area noisy and small
0	Some lovely restaurants close by and cheaper than in Venice

0	This is a good balance
0	Lido is a bit further but it feels more local and is more relaxing too , it gave us a taste of Dolce Vita
0	The boat ride was very pleasant , they dropped us in a glass blowing factory shop , the glass making demonstration was nice and there was very little pressure to buy
0	Internet was free for 20 minutesday but a bit slow like everywhere in Venice
0	So in short a good pick , good value for money

0	Unfortunately , I arrived while the front entrance was underconstruction

0	Personal super nett
0	Auf ansprechen der Mngel wurde ein Preisnachlass gewhrt
0	Wunderschne Zimmer , Bademantelgang optimal , Frhstck sehr lecker in gemtlicher Atmosphre
0	Parkplatz 8 Euro am Tag fr Gste des Hotels zhlt fr mich leider nicht zu gutem Service
0	sonst alles Bestens
0	Das Zimmer glich einer kleinen Ferienwohnung mit seperatem Schlafzimmer , Wohnzimmer mit kleiner Kchenzeile und Bad
0	Aufenthalt mit Hund war mglich und wurde sogar mit einer kleiner Aufmerksamkeit fr den Vierbeiner noch verschndert
0	Das Frhstck war sehr lecker und hatte eine reichhaltige Auswahl
0	Alles war sehr sauber und ordentlich
0	Lediglich an der Rezeption war ein Mitarbeiter sehr berheblich und patzig
0	Zuerst wurden wir eingewiesen und es wurde uns ein Parkplatz zugewiesen
0	Nachdem wir bereits standen und uns auf in den Ortskern machen wollten , hielt uns der Mitarbeiter an und teilte uns mit , dass wir nun pro Nacht fr den Parkplatz 15 zahlen mssten
0	Auf Nachfrage , warum uns das denn nicht vorher mitgeteilt worden sei , bekamen wir die patzige Antwort , dass das jawohl berall steht und auch auf der Website zu finden sei
0	Meine Meinung Selbst wenn   ein kundenfreundlicher Mitarbeiter htte 1
0	freundlicher Reagiert und 2
0	aus Servicegedanken in jedem Fall vorher nochmal darauf hingewiesen
0	Leider haben wir uns den Namen des Mitarbeiters nicht gemerkt
0	Die anderen waren jedoch alle sehr freundlich und deutlich hilfsbereiter als dieser eine
0	Alles in Allem kann man einen Aufenthalt hier sehr empfehlen   wenn man sich ggf
0	Schner SpaBereich , angenehmer Service , aufwendiges Frhstcksbffet
0	Zu Sauberkeit der Zimmer kann ich keine Angaben machen
0	Es war ein super Aufenthalt fr einen Kurzurlaub
0	Der Wellness Bereich ist total schn
0	Die Restaurants sind top   vor allem vom Ambiente
0	Das Frhstck war das bisher beste fr ein Hotel vor allem bis 1130  
0	Wir waren zu einem Kurzurlaub in Khlungsborn
0	Das Hotel macht einen guten Eindruck
0	Negativ war der Parkplatzmangel , ein berforderter Barkeeper am 30082015 und ein fehlender Fahrstuhl in die dritte Etage
0	Warum Es regnete
0	
0	Tolles Frhstcksbuffet , freundliches Personal , schner SpaBereich , Strandnhe
0	4 12 Sterne gebucht und nichts dafr erhalten
0	Wir haben ein abgewohntes , schmuddeliges Appartment verordnet bekommen
0	Nebenhaus mit Blick auf Parkplatz
0	Von Idylle keine Spur
0	Von mehr als vier Sternen schon gar nicht
0	Es hatte alles den Charme einer Jugendherberge der neunziger Jahre
0	Vorsicht niemand , der das nicht wirklich mag , sollte die Appartments buchen
0	Gereinigt wird vor Einzug wenig und whrend des Aufenthalts gar nicht
0	Ein oder zweilagig
0	Zur Selbstbedienung
0	Wahrer Luxus eben
0	Bademantel und Slippers sucht man auch vergebens
0	Das wre auch wirklich zu viel verlangt
0	Auch wenn die Appartments Mozart und andere klangvolle Namen tragen , sollte man eher nichts erwarten , dann wird man auch nicht allzusehr enttuscht
0	Vom Namen Mozart ausgehend es mssen Mozarts letzte Jahre gewesen sein , die in dem zugigen , modrigen Loch in einer dunklen Senke Wiens
0	Uitstekend hotel op een prachtige locatie en goede faciliteiten
0	Zimmer etwas abgewohnt aber noch ok , Service und Frhstcksbuffet sehr gut
0	Ein sehr erholsames langes Wochenende in Khlungsborn
0	Das Hotel liegt direkt an der Strandpromenade und zum Zentrum sind es nur wenige Minuten
0	Der Ort bietet sehr viel und wirkt durchgehend sehr gepflegt
0	Wir werden wieder dort hin fahren
0	sehr schnes Appartment in ruhiger Lage fr kleine Familie mit Kche und extra Kinderzimmer , so dass Selbstverpflegung gut mglich ist das Frhstck war reichhaltig und immer frisch bei Fragen oder Wnschen wurde immer sofort vom Personal reagiert   top
0	Sehr gutes Frhstcksbfett in sehr angenehmem Ambiente und aufmerksamen und freundlichen Mitarbeitern
0	Stock ohne Fahrstuhl
0	Mngel Sauberkeit der Balkone Tisch mit Flecken , Rahmen der Balkon stark verschmutzt   Rotweinflecken und jede Menge Deck Duschvorhang keine Kabine
0	Frhstck habe ich in einem 4 Haus schon Besseres geboten bekommen
0	War ok , aber keine 18 wert
0	Sehr schnes Haus , netter aufmerksamer Service , sehr gutes Essen einschl
0	Frhstcksbffet , aber Balkon nicht nutzbar , da die Entlftung der Kche genau am Balkon endet
0	Wir waren 4 Tage in dem Hotel und haben uns sehr wohl gefhlt
0	Sehr gut fanden wir auch die Lage des Hotels , man ist schnell am Strand und die Einkaufsmglichkeiten sind auch nicht weit entfernt
0	Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefhlt
0	Unser Zimmer war sauber und sehr nett eingerichtet
0	Wir waren trotz des nicht so schnem Wetter am Strand und dann ab in die Sauna oder in den Pool
0	Das war sehr entspannendDa wir von Montag bis Donnerstag da waren war es nicht so voll und das war sehr angenehm
0	Es gibt genug Geschfte zum Shoppen und man kann auch einfach nur an der Promenade spazieren gehen
0	Den Aufenthalt vom 3 bis 852015 haben wir sehr genossen
0	Leider haben wir erst zu spt erfahren , dass es mglich gewesen wre , sowohl einen Khlschrank als auch einen Heiwasserbereiter zu bekommen , denn das waren die Dinge , die wir in einem Doppelzimmer de Luxe vermisst haben
0	Unser Zimmer war wie gewnscht mit einem Aufzug erreichbar und hatte auch einen Balkon
0	NAME
0	Heizung i m Band und Schlafzimmer leider ungengend bzw
0	ausgefallen
0	Meldung an Rezeption innerhalb der ersten zwei Stunden des Aufenthaltes Samstag nachmittag
0	Antwort , dass man heute nicht mehr machen kann
0	Keine Entschuldigung oder sonstiges
0	Zweiter Tag dann wieder an der Rezeption Bad weiterhin eiskalt
0	Angebot , dass wir das Zimmer tauschen knnen , jedoch keinerlei Kompensation fr diesen Mangel in einem VierSterneHotel
0	Neues Zimmer Heizung warm , allerdings abends ein sehr strender Brummton , der nicht genau ortbar war Resonanz aus etlichen Lftungsrohren , die am Schlafzimmerfenster entlang fhrten
0	Beschwerde an Rezeption wurde wahrscheinlich in dem Moment wieder vergessen , in dem ich die Tr verlie
0	Service dieses Mal insgesamt sehr enttuschend
0	Die etlichen Besuche vorher waren deutlich besser
0	Ein sehr sauberes , gut gefhrtes Hotel mit schnem Wellnessbereich
0	Die Apartments sind leider in einem ca
0	50 m entfernten Haus untergebracht , welches man der Buchungsseite nicht entnehmen konnte und den Aufenthalt weniger komfortabel gestalten
0	Bei nicht so schnem Wetter ist es schon unangenehm den Weg ins Haupthaus zu nehmen
0	Das WLAN ist sehr langsam und die Aufzugstr schliet mit einem Tempo , welches einer Gesundheitsgefhrdung nahe kommt
0	Ansonsten sind die Apartments schn und zweckmig eingerichtet
0	Blick vom Balkon i m hinteren Teil auf den Hof oder den Parkplatz
0	Bei unserer Ostseerundreise waren wir 4 Nchte mit Frhstck in diesem Hotel
0	Wir hatten ein Deluxe Zimmer   war sehr ansprechend mit Balkon und Blick etwas verdeckt auf die Ostsee
0	Frhstck sehr gute Auswahl auch mit Fisch
0	Wellnessabteilung war auch gut
0	Nicht so gro aber ausreichend
0	Wir wrden dieses Hotel wieder buchen und knnen es auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen
0	Liegt auch gleich an der Strandpromenade und zur Einkaufsmeile ebenfalls nicht weit
0	Strand und Promenade direkt vor der Tr
0	Wir haben die 5 Tage richtig genossen
0	Ein besonderes Highlight war unsere Suite
0	bernachtung fr einen Tag

0	Sehr netter Empfang an der Rezeption
0	Sehr gute Zimmerausstattung mit riesiger Terrasse
0	Direkte Lage am Strand
0	Schne liebevoll eingerichtete Bar i m Erdgeschoss
0	Ein tolles Hotel
0	Wir haben uns gefreut , ein Hotel gefunden zu haben , das einen angenehmen persnlichen Charakter trgt
0	Sehr guter Service , freundliche und kompetente Kommunikation , wohlige Atmosphre
0	Wir kommen sehr gerne wieder
0	EIGENTLICH WAREN WIR WIRKLICH ZUFRIEDEN MIT DEM HOTEL , WIR HATTEN EIN DE LUXE DOPPELZIMMER MIT FRHSTCK UND KOSTENLOSEM WLAN ZUGANG FR 4 NCHTE GEBUCHTLEIDER WAR DAS WLAN   IMMERHIN 12,00 EURO   TAG   WHREND UNSERES AUFENTHALTES DEFEKT UND EINE KLEINE ENTSCHDIGUNG GAB ES DAFR AUCH NICHT
0	
0	Wir verbrachten eine Woche in Khlungsborn und fhlten uns sicher und gut versorgt
0	Das Hotel ist ideal gelegen zwischen KhlungsbornOst und West , gleichwohl ist alles Wichtige vor allem der Strand fulufig in ca
0	15 Minuten zu erreichen
0	Es war sehr schn , wir planen wieder dort hin zu fahren
0	Der erste Blick morgens war zum Meer
0	Das Personal war sehr nett und hilfsbereit
0	Zimmer waren sehr sauber , man hat sich dort gleich wie zu Hause gefhlt

0	Die Zimmer haben eine gemtliche Ausstattung
0	Das Frhstck bietet fr alle Ernhrungswnsche ein vielfltiges Angebot
0	Der Geniesser nimmt die vielfltigen Massagen und Behandlungen in Anspruch
0	Mit dem Fahrrad kann man die Region sehr gut erkunden
0	Heiligendamm liegt in unmittelbarer Nhe , aber auch Warnemnde kann man mit einem Fahrrad schnell erreichen
0	Insgesamt fr uns ein schner Aufenthalt
0	Es war ein toller Aufenthalt , ein schnes Zimmer und ein toller SpaBereich mit einer fantastischen Masseurin
0	Vier Tage Verwhnurlaub
0	Das Hotel zeichnet sich durch sehr freundliches Personal und liebe zum Detail aus
0	Das Frhstcksbuffett war jeden Morgen ein perfekter Start in den Tag , wir haben uns vom Hotel Fahrrder gemietet und haben eine Tour nach Warnemnde und zurck gemacht
0	Tolle Lage und super Ambiente
0	Das gebuchte Apartment war schn gro
0	Entspannend , hfliches und sehr freundliches Personal
0	Auch fr Alleinreisende geeignet
0	Ansonsten ist es einen Aufenthalt wert , schon gar wegen der Kche in der Orangerie
0	Das Hotel liegt sehr Zentral ist recht schnell zu Fu am Wasser oder zu dem verschiedenenen Lokalitteten Ein Toller Tip ist das Ostseebrauhaus und der Yachthafen
0	Empfang und Zimmer sehr angenehm freundliches und zuvorkommendes Personal , sehr gutes Frhstck

0	Das Zimmer 149 liegt direkt neben einem Abluftrohr einer Klimaanlage die den ganzen Tag sehr laut lief
0	Die Zimmer wurde nur gesaugt nicht einmal gewischt
0	Morgens war zu wenig Personal fr die Bewirtung i m Frstcksraum
0	als Familie erhielten wir trotz nur einer Nacht ein Upgrade , Frhstck sensationell
0	Das 4JahresZeiten ist ein strandnahes , aber ruhig gelegenes Hotel
0	Das Hotel hat trotz seiner Gre einen eher familiren Charakter und ist dadurch sehr angenehm
0	We will be back again and again and again
0	An experience for life
0	Just do it
0	Staff did their utmost to make our stay perfect , and perfect it was
0	Location is absolutely beautiful and secluded
0	Rooms and entire estate is very charming
0	Especially enjoyed taking the boats out on the lake
0	Hope to return some time in the future
0	We were picked up from the airport in a car which was not vacuum cleaned for a long time
0	That might sound like a small thing , but it is symbolic for the rest of our experience
0	Just not good enough anymore , except the bill
0	Running a place like this is like being married to a Harvard educated supermodel
0	It 's high More
0	On the shore of Lake Saranac , this is a very luxurious and peaceful place to stay
0	The food was high quality , and the service was perfect

0	Black More
0	The staff and service here are incomparable to most any place else you will ever stay
0	The setting is glorious , with great views of the lake and woods , and More
0	The point is possibly one of our favorite restaurants
0	The Point exceeds perfection
0	From the moment you arrive be prepared to indulge
0	The grounds and accommodations are very charming and comfy
0	Besides all the dead animals on the walls
0	It 's a 5 star sleep away camp for adults
0	The More
0	That is the name on one of their boats
0	And the essence of their philosophy
0	They have gotten the point and do everything right
0	Oh how More
0	The snow storm had More
0	Fantastic service , incredibly friendly staff , great food and the best fitness options in the entire city
0	The room smelled as soon as you walked in
0	Smelled very humid
0	Loved everything about the Houstoinan from the very attentive car valets to the door greeter
0	My only complaint concerns the bed pillows
0	Unfortunately they were very thin flimsy
0	Loved the pool area gym too
0	wonderful acomadation
0	Stayed one night to attend a meeting held the next day
0	Dined at inhouse restaurant , The Olivette , where the wine list and the meal were excellent and the service was very good
0	The attractively decorated rooms are very quiet with a forest view out the windows
0	It is hard to imagine you are in the middle of a major city here
0	The room was very clean and there was nice turndown service
0	The room was adequately lighted and there were outlets to charge electronics
0	There were nice pillows on the bed and the linens were crisp and newlooking

0	Return guest
0	Accommodation was great as usual
0	Wonderful stay
0	Great couples retreat
0	Will definitely be back for our anniversary
0	Staff is superb and do n't forget to eat at the restaurant downstairs Olivette
0	The Houstonian may not be the cheapest hotel in the area , but I believe it 's the best
0	It 's still a great value when you look at the service , amenities , and location
0	The grounds make it a wonderful oasis in a busy part of the city
0	Everything is kept up immaculately and is first class
0	The rooms have everything you could need for a comfortable stay
0	Highly recommended hotel
0	Thank you Houstonian
0	My problem with the hotel was room size   particularly bathroom size
0	The bedroom was adequate
0	The bathroom ceiling is at about 65 feet
0	The door opens into the tiny bathroom which makes it necessary to close the door making it extremely claustrophobic
0	This hotel is way over rated , it 's nothing like the description or the reviews
0	Basically its Old very old building in the heart of apartment complexparking lot jungle
0	Furniture is very old , hotel theme feel like 1850s , clean but old
0	Room it self spacious but old , old carpet and TV
0	Bathrooms similar to Motels , bedsheets clean , new sheets , but bed is saggy
0	Surrounding area is jungle , literally
0	Misty and not well kept
0	Lots traffic once you leave parking
0	Ppl come from surrounding complex apartments to run on trail
0	Bottom line , money wasted , will never come again
0	Staff were awesome
0	Will definitely go there again
0	swimming and tennis
0	Great resort facilities , several pools , including a lap pool and an enormous gym
0	Room was very comfortable
0	We went for the concierge package , which included complementary drinks , snacks and continental breakfast
0	Lovely
0	Fantastic hotel
0	We love the location , the food and the workout facilities
0	My kids especially love the basketball court
0	Hotel is very nice
0	High end finishes
0	Friendly staff
0	Bed was comfortable
0	There was some noise both from other guests and maintenance of grounds
0	Amenities are exceptional
0	Food in restaurants was also very good
0	Rooms and bathrooms are a little bit outdated , pool and spa is great
0	So relaxing and nice atmosphere
0	The spa serices near by were on point
0	Room and bathroom were extremely small considering the amount we paid per night to stay
0	We have stayed at the Houstonian before and it 's always top notch
0	Their holiday decor is amazing , and the staff is always so helpful
0	We took advantage of the bar for nightcaps and the large fireplace and comfy sitting area off the lobby for complimentary coffee and conversation
0	Great hotel
0	The pools were amazing
0	Wonderful stay with my boyfriend
0	Been staying there for 25 years
0	Great food , great gym , grounds amazing , staff super
0	Enough said
0	5 star accommodations as well as service
0	Even during the floods they had staff to help us
0	Combination business and family
0	Really liked the exercise facility and service all around
0	Good hotel
0	That put a twist on things , we drove around the corner anyhow
0	Everything was topnotch
0	From the courteous staff and great service down to every little detail
0	Our rooms were clean and well kept as well as all the public spaces
0	Indoor basketball and tennis court as well outdoor tennis courts just to name a few
0	Even has a lap pool not sure if it was olympic size though
0	All gears and equipment are provided free of charge so no need to bring racquets , balls and even shoes
0	The only thing that was somewhat awkward for us was that their recreational pool was filled wth mostly small kids and toddlers with their Soccer Moms or the Rich Wives of Beverly hills type of women
0	Not really encouraging for a full grown man who likes to drink his cold beer by the pool or teenage kidsyoung adults doing their horsing around or whatever
0	Their lap pool is always occupied and Waiting a while for a lane to be vacant somewhat takes the fun out of it
0	Over all , It 's a magnificent place to stay with so many things to enjoy while you 're at it
0	And as my title says , It 's a Country Club with a little touch of Hotel
0	The staff did try their best to makeup for the mishaps , which shows that they do care about their guests
0	The vanity and mirror is spacious , but definitely not for 2 people at once
0	The Trellis Spa and service from its staff is impeccable , and the gym and outdoor amenities makeup for the age of the hotel
0	The views out the windows all around the hotel are views of beautiful tress , as if you were in a secluded rainforest
0	As other reviewers mentioned , the valet service was really top notch and on their game
0	We will definitely be returning for a staycation at The Houstonian again
0	Thank you for making it a memorable Anniversary
0	We came in for wedding
0	The staff was exceptional
0	Loved the workout facility
0	The Hotel and its grounds are beautiful , to say the least
0	Very warm , very welcoming , very grand
0	The staff were incredibly professional and welcoming as well
0	Everyone from the front desk to the spa to the bar   same level of amazing service
0	Speaking of the spa   I have never had a spa experience like this
0	Unbelievable
0	The ultimate in luxury in relaxation
0	They did not charge us the extra night
0	I am seriously looking for excuses to stay at this hotel again

0	Incredible amenities made our family time relaxing and enjoyable , providing us with the perfect getaway escape and memories
0	
0	This is a beautiful hotel with great views and excellent amenities

0	The valets here are awesome
0	We had a great time there beautiful place with wonderful staff
0	Would love to go again
0	The hotel room was a lotttt smaller than I thought it would be
0	We ordered room service and there was a hair in the crab cake
0	Then it took an hour for us to get any kind of manager or staff member to actually help us
0	Excellent hotel   service was beyond anything we have experienced
0	Location is tremendous and the surrounding area is beautiful
0	Beautiful hotel , but very intimidating
0	Hard to figure out where the pools were
0	The property was lovely and the room was very comfortable
0	However the fitness facilities are truly amazing
0	The property is connected to the Houstonian Club which is a separate sports club that has truly world class facilities
0	It has 3 pools a massive lap pool , resort pool and other small quiet pool , the largest gym I have seen anywhere , basketball and tennis courts , a jogging track and at least 5 studios for classes
0	She went to 3 classes and the studios , instructors and equipment could not have been better
0	Further there is no need to register for any class you just turn up and participate
0	My wife also visited the spa and although it was expensive the facilities and service were again of the highest quality
0	The property is beautiful and the staff was a friendly and helpful as it gets
0	It was like a resort in the middle of Houston
0	The spa , fitness center and pools were a nice touch that enabled us to stay here and be entertained at the same time
0	Very nice
0	Family weekend Food was great Grandchildren used pool Family used health Club
0	Hotel and facilities are beautiful but room was very musty mildewy smelling
0	Beautiful hotel at a great value
0	The Olivette restaurant was spectacular   had dinner there both nights
0	If ur looking for a good night with comfy beds at a good price stay here

0	Finally got a room in the Zoo section where doors had beware of cat signs posted on doors and hall stunk of cat urine
0	Did More
0	Always very pleasant and cordial staff
0	Hotel was very clean and staff very nice
0	Beds are only double instead of Queen which makes traveling with two teenage boys not easy

0	Great for a two person stay , also free breakfast was for only two people , so had to pay for kids
0	This is my second stay recently
0	The pool is nice , but good luck finding a towel or staff person
0	Its not easy to get the complimentary breakfastyou need to know the secret handshake then be prepared to wait an hour for a server and even more for the meal to cook
0	I feel bad for the employees of this hotelthey are very pleasant but obviously over worked
0	This hotel is good if you need a place to crash but that is about it
0	The room was very clean

0	Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus

0	Restaurant food was good we got a 14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost 20 but service was very slow
0	The first floor , which we walked through to get to the elevator , reeked of cigarette smoke
0	This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs
0	This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room
0	Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area
0	The hotel was very clean , comfortable , and accommodating to the fact that we had a dog
0	It 's a decent hotel for the price
0	They provide a solid breakfast , and the rooms are really nice

0	It was an overnighter to get away from some stuff
0	Stayed overnight for pleasure

0	Pool was great
0	Hotel could use updating

0	Das Hotel ist in die Jahre gekommen und kaum erneuert worden
0	Die Lage ist f � � r Autoreisende als Etappenhalt geeignet , weil direkt an Autobahn gelegenAngenehm war , dass kein typisch amerikanischen Fr � � hst � � cksbuffet vorhanden war , sondern man am Tisch bedient wurde
0	Bei unserer Buchung gab es einen Kredit von 7 USD pro Person , welcher f � � r ein einfaches Fr � � hst � � ck ausreichend war

0	However , I was extremely disappointed that the pool was closed for renovations
0	Until you pulled back the shower curtain
0	The same old bathtub
0	Very friendly staff , VERY convenient location
0	Hotel smelled musty and had to move rooms water in shower would not turn off did not fell or smell clear either room would not stay again
0	This hotel was being remodled and should not have been renting rooms on the second floor where we were assigned , it was a total shambles including large holes in the curtains and debris laying everywhere
0	How could they expect anyone to stay in that kind of environment
0	We are disappointed with expedia on this one
0	The hotel was fine , just know that smoking is allowed on some floors so there is lingering tobacco odor in some corridors
0	O'Brien 's was a nice surprise , good food and great service
0	Also , a true breakfast is included with the price of the room , cooked to order not the typical complimentary breakfast buffet
0	The internet speed was good as well
0	One night layover
0	Hotel was good for that but would n't want to stay more than that
0	The hotel itself was quiet , and the location was easy to find but could use some updates
0	I went to use the gym and two out of the three treadmills were broken
0	The room was also beside the pool making it very humid and uncomfortable
0	The shower located in my room leaked all over the bathroom floor
0	The inside of the Hotel is old and it smells
0	The elevators had a n harsh smell of oil

0	It 's really false publicity
0	I will not be staying at that hotel again
0	Bathroom in the room was not cleaned
0	Mirrors were dirty
0	It 's like the rooms were done in a hurry
0	Roll away bed was pushed in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket

0	traveling with just myself and 2 small kids and the staff was helpful and kind , the food in the rest
0	was great and affordable
0	the hotel was great , clean etc
0	but that one desk lady was like not to helpful   and the business center is a desk next to the hotel desk and the computer did n't have Microsoft installed and that one desk lady is totally computer unaware and could not do anything to help with the business center malfunctions   except to say

0	Cramped location with odd entry by traffic light , clearly caters to groups and sports teams
0	Nicest staff ever
0	Room was clean and comfortable , is a single story building , so rooms go on forever down long hallways
0	Lucky we were near the gym , which was better than most
0	Great breakfast at a very reasonable price
0	Portions were huge
0	Free buffet with pizza , cheesecrackers , veggies and dip from 47pm on Friday evenings in the bar
0	Facility is a bit quirky and a bit tired , but staff is warm and friendlyWish we had eaten dinner there and not at the disappointing Chinese restaurant next door
0	They let us check in early and check out late for free
0	The hot tub was great , pool was a little loud because of school vacation but the attendant was the friendliest gentleman
0	Breakfast was definitely worth getting out of bed for
0	Will definitely consider staying there again for a getaway or business
0	This hotel is showing its age
0	Although my room was clean , everything seemed a little rundown
0	The carpets seemed old and the door frame had light from the hallway shining through it

0	The French toast was really good , same with the oatmeal the potatoes were missing that something special but not bad
0	Stay away from the turkey baconovercooked circles of leathery meatIt was sort of annoying that there was so many people packed into the pool , that it was n't worth going in , and that was the reason we choose the hotelThere were hockey , cheer , basketball , and gymnastics tournaments in town for the weekendSo hotels and restaurants all were at max capacity

0	Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair

0	The beds were uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit
0	The blinds were duct taped together and the parking lights came through the curtains
0	And the continental breakfast was a joke

0	HVAC was a problem that cause not a good sleep Restaurant service was slow not attending properly not good service for businessman
0	Room was really dry
0	And I got a rash from the salt water pool
0	goed
0	We had a good time , restuarant inside the hotel is kind of pricey but besides that it was a good time
0	Uninspiring and tired lookingI should have booked the Hotel across the street which looked newer was cheaperand next to a Starbucks
0	We found this motel to be pleasant , clean and affordable
0	Very helpful staff
0	The breakfast voucher for the restaurant was a delightful surprise for a real breakfast
0	I would highly recommend this Best Western
0	Ok place , needs some paint and new clean carpet
0	Stains on bed cover
0	The room , although fairly comfortable had the sink outside the bath
0	This created a problem when others were sleeping and someone needed to wash their hands
0	The breakfast in the restaurant was better than most places we have stayed , even though it was not as good as it could have been
0	Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair
0	The hotel was under renovations when we got there , that would have been nice to know prior to booking , it just did n't look nice from the outside and some area on the inside also
0	Other than that the staff were nice and accomodating , it was convenient to have a full restaurantpub in the hotel , for different optionsat breakfast , not just a continental breakfast bar
0	The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful
0	The restaurant is very good as well
0	Was happy that my room had a refrigerator and a nice little view of the courtyard
0	I suffered awful upper respiratory symptoms when the unit was in use
0	I 'm guessing the filters need to be cleaned andor replaced more frequently
0	Nice rooms
0	Very clean
0	Front staff was polite and courteous
0	Nice and friendly staff
0	Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel is in close proximity to Colby College Museum of Art great collection of regional and international artists
0	O'Brien 's Irish Restaurant and Pub is located on the property and offers a good selection of breakfast and dinner options
0	My understanding is hat this hotel was recently upgraded , although it is hard to tell colors and More
0	This hotel is used for Winter Romp each year
0	The cost is not too expensive
0	The room is a good size
0	There was two beds in the room
0	It is in good condition for the price we pay
0	There is lots of parking
0	Breakfast was included which was great
0	Will return again to thus
0	Hotel was convenient to I95 and well above average in appearance and appointments
0	Staff was very gracious and accommodating
0	Did not eat in restaurant because alternatives were very close by
0	Rate was not a bargain but worth the price
0	Hotel was good
0	Indoor pool was the draw AND it was actually very warm
0	Great job
0	However , I do NOT recommend eating at the hotel restaurantHORRIBLE service , soso food quality
0	With only 3 people at the bar and 2 in restaurant it should n't have taken 35 minutes to get an order of nachos , then when it came out , the order was wrong
0	Waited another 30 mins for the main dish
0	Good stay , but eat elsewhere
0	Conveniently located , very efficient staff , reasonably priced
0	Location of this hotel was convenient to 95 and not far from downtown by car to Waterville
0	This added a sense of less security to me as a single traveler
0	To our surprise the hotel was under a major reintivation , with construction materials everywhere , cluttered throughout , dirty and not well maintained
0	Anyone could enter the building
0	Crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building
0	The AC unit was very old with missing knobs and instructions that were worn off
0	Getting the room to a comfortable temperature was a challenge
0	Dirty used towels were hanging in the shower questioning whether the room had been properly cleaned from the prior occupant
0	Duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains
0	Worst experience at a hotel in my life time
0	To top it off , we paid way too much for the room based on the experience and status of the property
0	Terrible experience
0	I only booked this hotel because it was dog friendly
0	Halls reeked of marijuana
0	Pool was overpacked with non guests from a birthday party rental
0	They offer memberships to the pool and exercise room to non guests
0	Pool was not very clean
0	Was given 2 towels and wash clothes for 4 people in a room
0	Website stated free breakfast but neglected to say it was for 2 and you pay tax and gratuity for the free ones also
0	Website and book in room said there are snack vending machines and there are only ice and soda vending machines
0	Shower was luke warm and no way to make it warmer
0	Worst hotel I have ever stayed in
0	Please post these comments , thanks
0	Joe
0	We found this hotel while travelling and had read a few bad reviews due to it being renovated
0	We had time to go echeck it out before actually booking
0	We asked to see a room and were very pleasantly surprises by how lovely and new the hotel and room was
0	They
0	Have done a great job of the Reno
0	The hallways , rooms and main areas are clean plus and very tastefully decorated
0	The room had great beds and high end quality linens
0	The room was large and spacious
0	We stayed at the hotel for dinner as there was a barrestaurant on the premesis
0	Super friendly staff and the food was of very good quality for pub food
0	Nice not to have to go looking for a place to eat after being on the road all day
0	Another of the hotel amenities was the great gym and pool area
0	Dosen , t get any better anywhere
0	High end equipment , pool and jacuzzi , another great perk is , in the morning the from lobby staff give you a 700 voucher per person for breakfast in the hotel
0	This is not your average Best Western
0	My only complaint is the fact that people are allowd to smoke in some of the rooms
0	Smoking is not segregated by floors
0	To bad this hotel is allowing smoking within especially since they have done such a fine job of renovating
0	In this day and age , smoking in hotels or anywhere inside is just not acceptable
0	
0	Rooms were clean and relatively comfortable
0	The restaurant is more of a bar and we were the only people that ate there that evening there seemed to be quite a few people in the bar end though , the waiter was very helpful , the food was average burgers , sandwiches and fries
0	NB breakfast is not More
0	Excellent value , nice clean room , quiet , had fun at the bar our bartender was REALY nice and friendly

0	This hotel is absolutely disgusting
0	We requested a non smoking room , but the entire first floor smelled of smoke
0	Rooms are very old and dark
0	The little coffee machine in the room also did n't workit was just bad all the way around
0	I was n't expecting fancy being a best western but clean and not outdated would have been nice
0	Stay elsewhere
0	
0	Upgraded motel with an extremely comfortable bed and quiet room on the top third floor
0	The pool was huge and my kids loved it

0	The room was dirty when we checked in
0	Did not give us clean towels in spite of the request for those and housekeeping services

0	Go somewhere else if you need internet
0	Imagine if a hotel told you that because the place was full , the toilets were going to flush every once in a while , and that the best idea would be to flush when no one else was in the hotel
0	Apart from the internet , the place More

0	Mes enfants ont adoré la piscine surtout pour la température de l'eau salée et de l'air ambiante
0	Surtout après une sortie de ski de fond le matin à 5 km et du magasinage en aprèsmidi
0	Les journées étaient bien remplies
0	alors le séjour a bien été par contre la surprise est au sujet du déjeuné inclus , je constate qu'il y a un montant alloué par contre si ont veut bien déjeuné il y auras un surplus surprise il y a eu surplusfaudrait voir a bonifier le montant du déjeuné ou bien l'indiquer sur la fiche car un déjeuné a l'extérieure de l'hôtel deviens plus économique
0	Ganska lugnt läge
0	Hotellet har pool , restaurang och bar och även tillgång till gästtvättmaskiner   tummlare
0	よく見ると部屋はそれほど悪くはないが、ホテルに入ったとたん廊下などが汚くまた壁紙がよれて古さが強調される。レストランで食事をしたが肉も魚も調理し過ぎ 。 場所と値段で選んだが サービスは悪くないが口コミの評価のとおり 隣の町まで行った方がよかった 。
0	Dejligt ophold Heldig med vejret så vi kunne sidde udenfor og spise aftensmad

0	Good value
0	Good deal for the price
0	Das Hotel ist in die Jahre gekommen und kaum erneuert worden
0	Die Lage ist für Autoreisende als Etappenhalt geeignet , weil direkt an Autobahn gelegenAngenehm war , dass kein typisch amerikanischen Frühstücksbuffet vorhanden war , sondern man am Tisch bedient wurde
0	Bei unserer Buchung gab es einen Kredit von 7 USD pro Person , welcher für ein einfaches Frühstück ausreichend war
0	They had fun in the pool and hot tub
0	Overall the Hotel was nice
0	It was clean , the rooms were large , and the pool area was clean and everyone was friendly
0	Traveling with a dog and this was a nice , clean hotel and conference center

0	We go there because of the pool and hot tub
0	This hotel is very conveniently located just off I95 there 's a Ruby Tuesday Restaurant just a short walk away   we had a nice dinner there
0	The staff at checkin was not very friendly they just did their basic job and did n't look quite happy
0	Our room was clean and spacious king sized bed , flatscreen tv , fridge , microwave and a More
0	Pool staff do not enforce rules
0	Many adults buy memberships to the pool and fitness center , therefore have an expectation that they will be able to use the facility as it is intended
0	Instead , there are frequently screaming and out of control children at the pool , especially on weekends
0	The rooms are very nice , as is the restaurant
0	Not looking to break the bank on a hotel overnight   looking for clean , quiet and comfortable
0	This hotel fit the bill
0	But the TV worked , the heat worked , the More
0	I recently had two visits to this location
0	For both visits my reservation was for a room with a king bed

0	It was quiet even though there were many teenagers staying there
0	The breakfast was delicious
0	The people at the desk were very helpful and informative
0	We would certainly return to this hotel
0	The More
0	However , this is probably the best in the area
0	So , I 'd suggest 3rd floor
0	good location close to the highway , quiet rooms but small bathrooms , comfortable beds with luxury linens , friendly staff throughout and good food at the restaurant , make sure you try the prime ribit was excellentgreat value and a nice place to stay , pet friendly also
0	Overall a good place to stay
0	Restaurant served a great dinner although it was noisy , because it was wing night , it attracted a lot of beer drinkers
0	Also the room heaterfan was noisy
0	The sit down service breakfast was excellent and had a good selection
0	staff was not friendly
0	was just an overnite stay , was on a long trip and needed someplace to sleep for the nite
0	Got in at 930pm and left before 6 am so was good for that
0	That was the plan and it worked
0	Overall fine
0	It was a comfortable stay
0	I will say that the walls are a bit thin
0	The room was fairly clean
0	The beds were really comfortable
0	Breakfast was decent
0	The front desk clerk could be a bit more friendlier
0	I would stay there again
0	Luckily , our room was n't quite as bad

0	The bedspread was thin
0	The mattress was nice , however
0	The shower had good water pressure

0	Nice pillows
0	Close to a lot of eateries
0	Second year staying here for TrueFalse
0	The room is fine
0	Breakfast is better than a lot of other budget places
0	Considering the price , the hotel amenities and upkeep was as expected
0	The staff was friendly enough , the hotel smelled like mildew , serious updates were needed , and the continental breakfast was lacking
0	The bed was terribly uncomfortable
0	The pillows were hard and lumpylike when you wash and then high heat dry artificial pillow stuffing and it melts together
0	The AC unit did n't really work
0	It just blew air
0	I was hoping it would cool down to kill the mildew smell , but it never did
0	This continued through the night so needless to say , I did n't sleep very well
0	I would recommend this hotel to others

0	Hotel was clean and suitable for our needs
0	Beds were comfortable and it quiet compared to other locations we have stayed at in the past
0	Parking was very good considering the number of people who attend this type of event
0	We would stay here again in the future
0	Decent place , somewhat dated , and a strange musty smell
0	Room needed updating , but for the price I could deal with that
0	What I could n't overlook was the layer of dust and cobwebs covering the drapes that blows all over the room every time the air kicks on , or the toilet that is n't attached to the floor properly , or the drafty window , mildew stained tile , torn curtains , and cracked microwave door
0	It was a good hotel for that one night stay kind of a thing
0	Staff was great , bed was super nice , and location was perfect
0	It was just over used and cramped

0	Book early , on game weekends it sells out fast
0	Just a stop over for the night
0	The only clean thing about this hotel was the check in
0	So needless to say NO ONE slept in the 3rd bed
0	There was a dead bug under the counter that the coffee maker was on coffee and no cups the outlet by the coffee maker when we went to plug in the straighter it would just fall out , the outlet behind the nightstand was literally hanging out of the wall

0	I did n't feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone
0	The hotel was very mediocre   even less than what you would expect from a Super 8

0	El Hotel es lindo y el personal muy amable , la playa es muy cerca de las habitaciones y es muy bueno para familias sin embargo , tienen muchas oportunidades para mejorar
0	Las cabanas de la playa se deben reservar el dia anterior y no nos avisaron cuando llegamos al hotel , aunque se vende como Gourmet All Inclusive , la comida realmente no es gourmet y las opciones son limitadas
0	Ofrecen servicio de bebidas y alimentos en la playa y efectivamente existe , pero la persona encargada pasa por la playa cada hora
0	No tienen servicio de traslado areopuertohotelaeropuerto , hay que contratarlo aparte y el hotel no recomienda a nadie especifico
0	Parece ser que es algo atipico , pero habia demasiadas algas en el mar , lo bueno es que tenian personal contratado para limpiar la playa todo el tiempo , pero definitivamente no es suficiente
0	Las posibilidades de alimentacion para bebes , son muy reducidas y aunque efectivamente se pueden hacer solicitudes al chef , es muy demorado el servicio
0	Vi reste med vr 10 mnaders bebis och var vldigt njda med Azul Beach

0	Breakfast was good had something for the diabetic diet , but super crowded
0	Probably half the folks had to take breakfast back to their rooms
0	We rented 2 rooms with double beds , in both rooms the beds were very worn out
0	NOT COMFORTABLE
0	I paid close to double the price of what this hotel normally goes for
0	10 extra per night is not bad   it 's the mandatory 50 cleaning fee whether the animal makes a mess or not
0	Paid way more than I should for an establishment that did not earn that value
0	Nothing fancy but met our needs
0	Quiet , convient and staff very friendly and helpful
0	Beds were very comfortable
0	none
0	Price was a deal
0	Serving the breakfast saved us a lot of money
0	The family enjoyed their stay
0	Not deluxe but clean and quiet with friendly , competent staff
0	Good value
0	Everyone was very friendly
0	Breakfast area a little crowded
0	Overall a good stay
0	Clean room , good breakfast , easy access
0	Stay was very enjoyable
0	Hotel staff was friendly and always busy
0	We will definitely considering booking another stay when in the area
0	Plastic bottle
0	It does have a convenient squirt top
0	But overall , not very hot or tasty , and made mostly from jalapentildeos
0	The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better
0	Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanutsthe peanuts were actually small sized unsalted
0	Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as Jumbo
0	This is a confection that has been around a few centuries
0	It is a light , pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts   in this case Filberts
0	And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar
0	And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven
0	Not too chewy , and very flavorful
0	I highly recommend this yummy treat
0	The flavor is very medicinal
0	Great taffy at a great price
0	There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy
0	Delivery was very quick
0	If your a taffy lover , this is a deal
0	I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag
0	The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors watermelon , root beer , melon , peppermint , grape , etc
0	I would recommend this brand of taffy   it was a delightful treat
0	This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy
0	Each candy was individually wrapped well
0	None of the candies were stuck together , which did happen in the expensive version , Fralinger 's
0	Would highly recommend this candy
0	I served it at a beachthemed party and everyone loved it
0	This taffy is so good
0	It is very soft and chewy
0	The flavors are amazing
0	Very satisfying
0	
0	They love it
0	This is a very healthy dog food
0	Good for their digestion
0	Also good for small puppies
0	I do n't know if it 's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients , but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind
0	One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other did n't
0	The higher food sits going stale
0	They both really go for this food
0	And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week
0	I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different
0	I 've noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past
0	good flavor
0	these came securely packed they were fresh and delicious
0	i love these Twizzlers
0	The Strawberry Twizzlers are my guilty pleasure   yummy
0	My daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot
0	It 's exactly what you would expectsix packages of strawberry twizzlers
0	It is not too sweet
0	I will definitely be ordering more

0	Product received is as advertisedbr br a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB001GVISJMTwizzlers , Strawberry , 16Ounce Bags Pack of 6a
0	The candy is just red , No flavor
0	Just plan and chewy
0	I do n't know if it 's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients , but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind
0	I have never been a huge coffee fan
0	br The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good CoffeeLatteCappuccinoetc in less than a minute if water is heated up
0	I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone
0	Too good for the price and I'am getting one myself
0	
0	This offer is a great price and a great taste , thanks Amazon for selling this productbr br Staral
0	There is no escaping the fact , however , that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation
0	Still , the McCann 's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal
0	It 's even better than the organic , allnatural brands I have tried
0	All the varieties in the McCann 's variety pack taste good
0	Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff
0	Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy , tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum
0	But this is a convenience product
0	Maybe the guar gum is why , after sitting in the bowl a while , the instant McCann 's becomes too thick and gluey
0	This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand
0	It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup , so not only does it have a better sweetness , but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you
0	The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too
0	Plus they do n't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart
0	Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl
0	McCann 's regular oat meal is excellent , too , but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning
0	For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store
0	br br Thanks , br Abby
0	What else do you need to know
0	Oatmeal , instant make it with a half cup of lowfat milk and add raisinsnuke for 90 seconds
0	More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something
0	It 's still just oatmeal
0	Mmm , convenient
0	FOUND IT TO BE VERY TASTEFULL WHEN MADE WITH WATER OR POWDERED MILK
0	IT GOES GOOD WITH OJ
0	She has this almost every morning and likes all flavors
0	br a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB001EO5QW8McCANN 'S Instant Irish Oatmeal , Variety Pack of Regular , Apples   Cinnamon , and Maple   Brown Sugar , 10Count Boxes Pack of 6a
0	Convenient , healthy , very quick , excellent quality , and extremely cheap
0	McCann 's makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur , whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour , to the sloth addled instant , which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes
0	Tastes great and very healthy
0	McCann 's Oatmeal is a good quality choice
0	For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes , this is excellent
0	This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands , but it is somewhat mushy and does n't have quite as much flavor either
0	Good oatmeal
0	I like the apple cinnamon the best
0	The flavors are good
0	I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor
0	The regular is fine with brown sugar added
0	The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK
0	This is a very quick , easy and satisfying breakfast and I 'll order this brand again , but not the variety
0	I 'll get all Maple and Brown Sugar
0	This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores
0	There is nothing healthy about it
0	It is just carbs and sugars
0	Save your money and get something that at least has some taste
0	This oatmeal is not good
0	Its mushy , soft , I do n't like it
0	Quaker Oats is the way to go
0	So i m here to buy more , and noticed there were no reviews yet , well now there is
0	Perfect for us
0	This was n't in stock the last time I looked
0	They are hot
0	It requires a beverage as advertised , a glass of very cold milk , and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run
0	He 'll be so insulted
0	we 're used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy
0	doubt very much habanero is used at all
0	could take it up a notch or two
0	These beans Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura seem to be wellsuited for this method
0	The first and second cracks are distinct , and I 've roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time
0	The aroma is strong and persistent
0	The taste is smooth , velvety , yet lively
0	We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill about 13 of the bag at a time
0	The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too
0	More importantly , the coffee is smooth no bitter aftertaste
0	Deal was awesome
0	Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters
0	I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store 's candy
0	It is chocolate , what can I say
0	Great variety of everything our family loves
0	With a family of six it goes fast here
0	Perfect variety
0	Kit Kat , Reeses , take five and more
0	Great product , nice combination of chocolates and perfect size
0	The bags had plenty , and they were shipped promptly
0	The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies
0	The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many
0	Watch your prices with this
0	This bag of candy online is pretty expensive , it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores , other than that , its a good combination of my favorite candy
0	
0	Same for desert racing in the buggy , the camelbaks were always laced with the powder
0	Now we have the Fizzwhat a great product
0	Firstly , its Hammer 's endurolyte product so it 's great , endurance athlete 's the world over use their products
0	Second its convenient , handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz
0	Third it tastes great
0	The camelbaks always get the Fizz now
0	I can not recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough
0	This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides
0	Pop 1 into each water bottle and you 're set
0	Flavor is fine and goes down easy
0	I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue
0	Gatorade was n't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a lowcarb alternative
0	The zero carb sports drinks did n't help so what to do
0	There is no hint of sweetness , and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice
0	The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I 've tasted
0	But in retrospect , the price is a little ridiculous esp
0	when you add on the shipping
0	this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds
0	my fault
0	These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality
0	The bears even have little faces
0	At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff bears , rings , snakes , balls , worms , whatever are about 10 lb
0	These twin packs of 45 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I 'm concerned
0	I 'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin ' things
0	Consumed
0	Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area
0	I love grape flavored candysoda and these are pretty good
0	There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion , but these are well worth it for the price
0	I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink
0	The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles , and the gummy bears are awesome frozen
0	They are delicious
0	It arrived fresh and intact
0	Very good size
0	I froze half for later use
0	The pastry was soft , the jam was really good and the taste was great
0	They were gone in no time
0	My guests were really impressed
0	Buyer Beware Please
0	This sweetener is not for everybody
0	Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body
0	Nausea , diarrhea   headaches can also be experienced
0	The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before
0	I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping
0	As the symptoms passed , this too was very unpleasant
0	Thank goodness I 'd eaten only a little
0	I still ended up with all the same sideeffects but for a much shorter duration
0	Some people can use maltitol to their heart 's content but others , like me , can have a bad reaction to it
0	It is okay
0	No tea flavor at all
0	Just whole brunch of artifial flavors
0	It is not returnable
0	I wasted 20 bucks
0	These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix
0	Unfortunately , they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate
0	These taste really good
0	I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture
0	There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items
0	Order in cold weather and buy enough to last
0	
0	The taste was great , but the berries had melted
0	May order again in winter
0	it tastes crisp
0	This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat
0	Great gift for all ages
0	I have been looking for this for a while now , not for food science , but for something more down to earth
0	I also bought lowfat noninstant milk powder and regular milk powder
0	The noninstant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant lowfat milk , but does not dissolve good in cold water   which is not a problem for hot coffee
0	Also , I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it 's own
0	Take the time to experiment
0	Maybe you do n't use any lowfat milk
0	Or do n't add any flavorings
0	It is up to you
0	I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients
0	Awesome dog food
0	As soon as I changed to a different formula , the scratching stopped
0	So glad Natural Balance has other choices
0	My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food
0	Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food
0	Great food
0	I love the idea of one food for all ages   breeds
0	Ît 's a real convenience as well as a really good product
0	My 3 dogs eat less , have almost no gas , their poop is regular and a perfect consistency , what else can a mom ask for
0	
0	I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food
0	This food is great   all ages dogs
0	They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick
0	What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties
0	This is the same food we get at pet store
0	But it 's delivered to my door
0	And for the same price or slightly less
0	I 've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food
0	Since switching I have n't had any issues
0	It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for largersmaller sized dogs
0	I 'm sold
0	
0	Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods
0	This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the foodbr This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved
0	This was the second one we tried , and it has been working ever since
0	It 's for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food like chicken or beef
0	We will not be buying this again
0	It 's also super expensive
0	The only draw back , shipping cost
0	These are very heavy
0	Arrived slightly thawed
0	My parents would n't accept it
0	However , the company was very helpful and issued a full refund
0	The crust on these tarts are perfect
0	These are absolutely scrumptuous
0	The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are
0	What a nice alternative to an apple pie
0	Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing
0	Easy to prepare
0	I like Creme Brulee
0	I loved that these were so easy
0	Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil
0	They look amazing and taste great
0	I will be ordering more
0	not what I was expecting in terms of the company 's reputation for excellent home delivery products
0	I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite
0	These are even better than the ones from the Amish market
0	They are fantastic , and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom
0	They wo nt go to waste
0	I love asparagus
0	Up until very recently , I had never had pickled asparagus
0	I 've got 2 jars left
0	Gon na need more
0	
0	I wanted things that were tasty , nonfat and low in calories
0	I came home with about a dozen items
0	That 's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus
0	This Tillen Farms brand is really , really good
0	It 's the best I can recall
0	There 's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in the bottom of the jar which I 'm looking forward to eating
0	I ca n't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says only 60 calories per jar
0	I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix
0	I have been drinking this tea for a long time now
0	I used to have to purchase it at a doctor 's office because it was n't available elsewhere
0	Wonderful taste
0	I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping
0	I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits
0	Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier coffe and other drinks do not   the only healthier drink is quality cold water
0	This green tea has a beautiful golden color , the taste is bright and fresh
0	I recommend adding a tiny amount of YS
0	Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too
0	The one shipped displays NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea , whereas the Amazon package displays CAFFENE FREE
0	The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag
0	So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it
0	this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted it 's clean , bright , freshbr br great deliveryagain quality just try it
0	I love , love this green tea
0	I will definitely order from this seller again
0	Thanks
0	I love this tea
0	This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or midday snack
0	Great routine and treat for kids
0	The female , younger one took to it right away , and the older male , who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc in it , and would usually refuse a diet change , actually liked it too
0	He is a posh cat after all
0	Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal
0	Is that right
0	She 's tiny , but happy and agile
0	Mainly , he loved the taste even more
0	That is also according to my holistic veterinarian
0	It stopped her problems
0	It aids in digestion since theok sorrysmells are gone if ya know what I mean
0	Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food
0	The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well
0	It 's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me
0	Innova 's manufacturer was recently purchased by ProcterGamble
0	I began looking for a replacement
0	It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters
0	My holistic vet recommended this , along with a few other brands
0	The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear
0	One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef
0	This formula is one of the few she can eat , and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet
0	Both of my kitties are very active , have soft shiny fur , and neither are fat
0	Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth , also
0	Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food
0	They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great
0	They are fit and not over weight
0	This vendor ships extremely fast
0	Too bad it 's way too expensive here on Amazon
0	It is n't hot at all to a chilihead like me , but it sure is good
0	Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor
0	I do n't find this to be the case with this soup
0	Any flavor is killed off by the burn
0	I really loved the spicy flavor these had
0	I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite
0	I love this flavor of ramen
0	It 's unbelievable
0	It 's fibrous like the real ginger , has that spicy kick to it , but it 's perfect with the sugar   calms it down
0	It 's very worth the 40 for 5lbs of it
0	Delicious
0	Now I can enjoy it without traveling
0	I keep trying other brands cheaper brands
0	Stupid me
0	This ginger IS soooo worth the money
0	Tender , moist and never a let down
0	What a surprise
0	He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it
0	This product was a God send for him
0	Thank you all for it
0	Because it 's bite size it 's easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick
0	My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping
0	I love thesevery tasty
0	Savings are about a 100 a bag
0	I use subscribe and save on these and several other product
0	I love subscribe and save
0	
0	If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children , then be sure to try these
0	We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack
0	Great item , great price too , highly recommend
0	I might be mistaken , but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size
0	If they did do that , it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal , having so many pieces after all
0	The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience
0	As it is , you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size it is not the same
0	This is one of the best tasting salsas I 've ever had
0	My daughters love it too
0	The salsa is not too sweet , just sweet enough and although it 's mild , it has a nice little kick to it
0	At this price , it 's a steal
0	Therefore , the bottoms were broken on all three bottles
0	NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER FED EX IS CAREFUL , IT 'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE
0	ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER
0	BARBARA L S
0	This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack
0	The other two that come with it are not worth your money
0	This is the best cornmeal
0	I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding
0	Also fried some oysters with this meal , it gave them a great texture and flovor
0	This is a fabulous marinade
0	DEFINITELY worth the price
0	Super cheap and super easy
0	Love it
0	Works with chicken fish beef or pork
0	Fast easy and makes it taste excellent
0	Plus buying in bulk is more than 50 off from box stores
0	It actually tastes pretty good
0	These singles sell for 250   336 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles
0	Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite , but truly this is not a good buy
0	AWESOME
0	I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful
0	This jello is wonderful
0	Great made as regular Jello too
0	Yummy
0	What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use
0	This box should last our family the year no problem
0	Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will
0	Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket
0	We love it
0	Shakes well , no clumping and flows freely
0	The tuna , tomato combination is delicious
0	The taste of the tuna was not pleasant , too much basil and other spices for me
0	I 'm not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict , gave this a shot
0	The tuna tastes like it 's good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland
0	It 's better than something plain but it did n't pack the punch I was hoping for
0	It 's still a great option for a low calorie , low fat meal
0	I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there
0	Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come
0	There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack
0	You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor
0	It 's dark , syrupy , sour , and a little sweet
0	A dab of this and I forget about dessert
0	It 's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone
0	Yum
0	I 'm going to try making fesenjan next
0	Used this in Moroccan recipes , as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water
0	Wonderful , wonderful stuff
0	I ca n't even return these or ask for a refund , because food is not returnable
0	Will find a different brand to use
0	For now , I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away
0	Besides being smaller than runts , they look the same and have the same consistency
0	Yucky stuff
0	Trying to return with vendor
0	Also when I received the item , the packaging was not great
0	The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope
0	They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy
0	I purchased 5
0	I love this stuff in milkbr It 's much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk
0	Check it out
0	This 88243 Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only 1895
0	It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top , before serving
0	The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling
0	The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake
0	The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor
0	It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong
0	The stronger it is the less you use as well
0	The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost
0	This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like
0	One of the best lemon juice that I have tried
0	I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product
0	This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen yearround
0	It has a powerful flavor and you do n't need much of it to zest up a dish
0	Fast delivery and good product
0	This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it 's really handy to have around to add to sauces , dressings , etc
0	Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it , nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with
0	This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice , but it is good
0	It has a slightly odd flavor , perhaps from a preservative
0	Sure wish I could order the frozen juice
0	Could n't believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was
0	Seriously , drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime
0	I like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price
0	This is an great product
0	The taste is great , and it works exactly as described
0	Superb natural sleep aid
0	AMAZING
0	Yes , we 'd probably be better served taking a yoga class , but this is a good second choice
0	This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep
0	The product arrived with 2 broken bottles , which at this price is a 6 loss
0	The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the smallbubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box
0	Big packing fail , but the product is awesome
0	The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned
0	Our friends could n't discern any difference from classic CCCs
0	The texture , body , and elasticity meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other glutenfree flours is nice and chewy   the same as CCCs made with regular flour
0	This is great stuff
0	Made some really tasty banana bread
0	Good quality and lowest price in town
0	This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts
0	I am about to make one for a pie auction at church , after a friend requested that something strawberry should be offered
0	You can make the most amazing and relatively healthy fruit tarts by baking a base , layering it with uncooked , fresh , sliced fruit , then pouring over the madeup contents of one of these packets
0	I 've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes , to hold a fruit topping in place
0	To do this , slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it 's still in the springform pan
0	Pour on the glaze , let it set up and then remove the springform
0	You 'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake
0	Just blindbake the muffin tins lined with pate , then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits berries are great and pour over the glaze
0	The smell is kinda strong , but not bad
0	It 's tolerablel
0	I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants
0	I did n't expect it to taste good , but it actually does
0	
0	The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright
0	There is just a slight vitaminy taste , but it 's not overwhelming
0	It 's also a bit pricey for what you get
0	This coffee is great because it 's all organic ingredients
0	No pesticides to worry about , plus it tastes good , and you have the healing effects for ganoderma
0	Like the other people mentioned , this coffee has a great taste
0	I 've tried different instant coffees before , but this one is one of the better ones
0	Tastes great , and gives me energy without the jitters
0	Love this productbr However , I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a ziplock pouch because the ziplock ripped off and quit working after awhile
0	But the product is fantastic , just not crazy about the packaging
0	These little guys are tasty and refreshingbr br I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath
0	Cheers
0	it 's a real mintbr br Cons none
0	LOLOLOL
0	
0	These mints are really strong and have a great taste
0	They are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse
0	This is a huge supply of them
0	I 'm still working on these and have plenty to spare
0	Much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 711 every time you want a mint
0	These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a ripoff
0	Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares
0	Or how about the cereal ploy , they were filled at the factory but settled in transportbr Can manufacturers be honest in their dealings
0	Also line with felt to keep earrings
0	Perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and LOVE the mints
0	Received as shown
0	The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability
0	The packaging is small for convenience , and the Altoids are smaller as well with a square shape , blue hue , and even more delicious taste in my opinion
0	Highly recommended
0	Fresh scent and taste
0	Easy to eat one tin in few hours
0	Hard to find the wintergreen smalls sugar free as stores only have the red smalls peppermint such a common flavor
0	The wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious
0	To me , these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints
0	They are pleasanttasting little candies in a cute convenient tin , and that 's as far as it goes
0	The mintiness is just not strong , and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis
0	At this point , I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints
0	These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters
0	They loved the Iams
0	After a certain age , we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods and lower carb foods , because the catties were fatties
0	We tried a few types of food
0	Some evinced no change
0	Some made the litter superstink
0	No problems to speak of
0	It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose
0	The cats love it
0	The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing
0	And here 's the kickerbr After feeding the cats Felidae , their demeanor improved
0	Their coats are super soft and lush both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food
0	She 's an older cat , somewhat overweight , and had a grouchy temperament
0	I do n't agree with the previous reviewer that cats do n't like it
0	Clearly , mine does
0	That is what the vet told us ten years ago
0	The youngest is a blob
0	Too much of a good thing
0	By this time , the cats could n't keep it in or down
0	What a mess
0	We 've moved on
0	As with canidae , Felidae has also changed their formula
0	Cats do not like change when it comes to their food
0	And they just had to change it without putting it on their label
0	We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell
0	If cats get upset because of a change in enviorment , or a loud noise they can stop eating
0	It depends on the cat
0	Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight
0	It was n't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick
0	Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it
0	This is just horrible
0	Do n't buy just a few of these
0	I order these by the case
0	I order these olives a lot
0	They are unlike any other olives out there
0	The subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses
0	One of my favorite appetizer treats for guests
0	Hey , the description says 360 grams   that is roughly 13 ounces at under 400 per can
0	No way   that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can
0	At 7 lb
0	in a retail store or a little over 9 with shipping from an online merchant , I think it 's great
0	Most of them were over 30 lb
0	with shipping
0	Has everything I 'm looking for in a strong , fullbodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring
0	I love strong , full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam , irish breakfast or early grey tea , but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging
0	So I have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that was n't bitter at a more palatable price point , and this certainly fits the bill
0	And unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another , ie
0	iced vs hot , this tea is excellent in both forms
0	I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that does n't cost an arm and leg
0	One reviewer is right , I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma
0	But this is black tea , and this aroma kind of remind me the ' softness ' of white tea
0	It 's full body like a good cup of Assam , which by no means overpower the delightful , clean taste of Darjeerling , complete with a long lasting note of bergamot
0	I enjoy it best in the evening
0	It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy daybr br For those interested in the specifics I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug , let it steep in 208F water for 23 min , take the infuser out , and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication
0	This is an excellent tea
0	One of the best I have ever had
0	It is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar
0	Herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste
0	It is only for people who like herbal taste
0	I do n't
0	Makes a tasty , super easy meal , fast
0	BUT high in caloriesbr br The instructions say to saute the veggies first but I recommend cooking the chicken first
0	The chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess
0	I made it with snow peas and carrots only
0	I do nt like the little corn
0	Added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice
0	It came out wonderful
0	Dinner on the table in less than 30mins
0	Most have too much sugar or worst , corn syrup
0	This mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty
0	It does have a little kick
0	Enjoy
0	Might be a little spicy for some , but this stuff rocks
0	Took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste
0	But now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand
0	This candy is not as described
0	The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as describedbr Looks and tastes like it 's way past it 's expiration datebr Would never reccommend this
0	Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing
0	I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste
0	It also has a natural sweetnessbr br The ingredients include Organic WuLi Cliff Oolong Tea 700 mg , Organic Black Tea 600 mg , Organic Green Tea Extract 100 mg , Proprietary blend 600 mg , plus some Ginseng panax , Orange Peel , Lemon Grass , and Guarana
0	Other Ingredients Natual Orange and Citrus flavorsbr br My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee
0	I 'll be coming back to this one
0	just try it on red juicy watermelon , wonderful experience
0	Terrible
0	Artificial lemon taste , like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish
0	Do n't do this to yourself
0	Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest
0	These things are huge
0	I love the way the crystals crunch , and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle
0	This lemony flavor is my favoriteit 's good on almost everything
0	How misleading the packaging of the box is
0	The photo on the box I bought these in store makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads expanding the length and width of the box
0	Wrong
0	FAIL
0	Not ecofriendly at allbr br Would I buy these again
0	No   I feel ripped off
0	This is the ultimate puppy food
0	The kibbles are great for small breeds
0	High in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use
0	Less waste results from the high quality ingredients
0	Never have I seen such gas issues
0	Both of them consistently had foul gas
0	Consistently
0	But , they continued to have gas
0	No more farting
0	I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies
0	They just need that in their diet
0	Yeah right , you try dealing with gas for that long
0	Much better
0	Fresh , a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories
0	They taste just like chocolate pudding
0	Each packet of tea weighs 500 grams , which equals 11 pounds or 176 ounces
0	This tea is good mornings , afternoons or evenings
0	I use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot
0	Hi , I have to have black tea everyday
0	Ahmad Tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea
0	Great flavor with no lingering aftertaste
0	I 've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea , with enough aroma and taste , and beautiful reddish color , perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own , but a decent base for mixesbr This tea , however , is nothing of the sort
0	Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell , and the brewed tea is weak , flat and tasteless
0	Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore
0	I love love love this deal   it 's way fun to pick from so many
0	Teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees
0	The other outfits that assemble samplers are boring   they do the choosing , and from a much narrower range
0	The sellers here are very nice , also , and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method it 's easy
0	Who cares
0	good products and fast shipping equals a happy me
0	WOW
0	This product is very impressive
0	I bought the 8 oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging , price and shipping
0	The powder dissolves instantly
0	Even in water
0	This product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries , especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away
0	I definitely will being trying the other flavors soon
0	The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry
0	Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme
0	Five minutes in , one tentacle was bitten off , ball inside cracked in half
0	Not durable enough to be a dog toy
0	Disappointed
0	So is the dog
0	I am chemical sensitive as well as sugarfree
0	Once in a while I drink a full bottle before a workout
0	Compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there I highly recommend this
0	This product is clean and does n't leave nasty chems behind in the body
0	Try it before you judge from a review   everyone 's body reacts differently
0	I paid 399 for this drink
0	Most energy drinks can not be made w out a high dosage of caffeine
0	But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safebr br Now you 're NOT sensitive to caffeine , then it 's a great buy
0	It 's not loaded w sugar
0	The taste is easy and pleasant
0	It 's not loaded w a bunch of chemicals like 5Hour shots or Starbucks drinks
0	And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours
0	These Nature Valley Nut Lovers Variety Pack was perfect
0	Although I was n't sure about the peanut butter bar , it was excellent
0	Quick shipping and very fresh
0	It reeks like a chemical rubber smell
0	This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid
0	Unbelievable
0	The product is faulty
0	Period
0	I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership
0	The flavor is fantastic
0	However , they do not supply a gallonsized tub , and Dr Mercola has the best product in that size category
0	Also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs
0	Stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking , too
0	Good product , good value
0	A great healthy product
0	I really enjoy this product
0	I had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store
0	Thanks so much
0	My most recent purchase , however , was disappointing
0	The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 14th of the regular size
0	Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw
0	It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes
0	They have had many complaints of a similar nature
0	This , they claimed , also reduced the crystal size
0	They said this problem should go away with their newer crop
0	The representative said that the newcrop sugar will have a 610 digit date code without ANY spaces that ends with a 1 and no letters
0	The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar
0	My recent badpurchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a 51A
0	Bottom line their current product is not much better than much cheaper products
0	Love this sugar
0	Recommend
0	Product is exactly as advertised
0	What a savings
0	At least half the retail price
0	Easy to store because of the individual packaging
0	I do not eat much sugar , but still
0	This sugar is called turbinado sugar , but is misleading
0	I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass
0	What a shame on the producer
0	It 's just sugar in the raw , it 's flavor profile is much better then white sugar and it 's suppose to be better for you or something
0	I just wish the bags were resealable
0	This is a delicious sugar
0	It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma
0	But the granules are quite big , however   bigger than plain refined sugar
0	This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together
0	It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer
0	I only use raw sugar , it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good
0	Will buy again
0	This sugar is very good
0	My only complaint is the price
0	I loved the higher molasses content Sugar in the Raw
0	I really love this sugar and pricewise it 's much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else
0	Love this sugar
0	It tastes so much better and is n't as overly sweet tasting as regular sugar
0	The price that Amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff
0	Ca n't say anything bad about Sugar in the Raw
0	I like it better than the other natural sugars
0	Better consistency and   I know it does n't matter   but better color
0	Unfortunately , one of the natural paper bags got torn a bit in the box
0	Great service
0	Items arrived faster than expected
0	Very efficient
0	Will use this seller again
0	I highly recommend this seller
0	Thank you for the excellent service
0	Please ignore the onestar comments , if you check the bag the main ingredient IS in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower
0	With anything that is gluten free you have to add another binder which is where the corn flour comes in
0	For someone who has celiac disease and can not have Sunchips , because they contain wheat a key binder to any chip , cookie or cereal this is an excellent product
0	Best flavor ever
0	I 'm addicted
0	They are all good but these are by far the best
0	I could live on these
0	And there is no need for anymore to say
0	So many healthy products do n't taste very good
0	The only problem is I can eat the entire bag in one sitting
0	I give these crisps a big thumbs up
0	This is one of the best tasting crisps I have ever eaten
0	The name is deceptive   these have Masa corn flour listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste
0	Ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird tin can taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever
0	For some reason this product does n't have that
0	I also make indian dishes with this , and spicey spaghetti sauce
0	the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores
0	dissapointing
0	howdy y'all , br br the actual product is VERY good   i 'd rate the item a 4 on it 's own
0	br br For comparison , I 'm comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa
0	I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though
0	This is a fantastic product , and I wish it was readily available in most stores
0	It 's taste is not the greatest , but it 's a 25 oz
0	shot , and it 's gone in a second
0	It tastes , more or less , like a concentrated sweet tea
0	I will put up the taste for the results
0	It 's got 150 mg of caffeine , which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters
0	I ca n't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes , and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it
0	The sugar is at 9 g , which is n't horrible
0	I used to drink 4 16 oz
0	It worked well , but gave me a jittery feeling , almost headachy but not quite
0	And the price is ok , on Amazon anyway
0	It 's all about me feeling good
0	Good stuff
0	I like this products because it is more natural then the others
0	Plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work
0	Great value
0	This one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better
0	Especially on the turnpikes where it 's just way too expensive
0	It 's worth the   per shot
0	My husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost
0	I would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there
0	I 'll be ordering again soon for sure
0	I purchased it because it was on sale
0	In terms of the energy it provides , it works , but the taste leaves something to be desired
0	I tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable
0	As a software engineer , this is entirely unacceptable
0	The energy shot truly does work
0	I always have some water handy as a chaserwhich helps
0	Yay
0	
0	This is my favorite in terms of taste and effect
0	Plus , it 's somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used
0	If you 're looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals , this is a great option
0	The taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters
0	I fell in love instantly
0	The drink is delicious   I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice , like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea
0	The rush it gives me is slow and even
0	I love it
0	It has no sugar high   no crash
0	The price is very good
0	I 've seen it over 2 bucks in the store
0	Products takes pretty good , and it does n't leave you gittery
0	With subscibe and save as well as Prime membership I pay below   2 a shot
0	I do not get jittery or crash
0	It also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant
0	The most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well , or perhaps I 'm getting more used to it
0	I do n't drink it for the flavor , but it 's not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other , nonorganic energy shots
0	This is the first time I 've really been misled by other reviews on amazon
0	Boy am I sorry
0	And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards
0	8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it
0	Unless you really like things that taste of a weird teaflavored cough syrup and do n't work , do n't buy this
0	I do n't know what to do with the other 11 bottles
0	big fail
0	I loved this mold
0	But there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that
0	It served it 's main purpose
0	The regular chocolate ones are good , but THESE are the BEST EVER
0	
0	Try this you might like it
0	The price is really good and well worth the purchase
0	I will be back for more
0	This tricolor couscous is really goodfull of flavor and fun to eat
0	I love the texture
0	I cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs parsley , cilantro , along with some red pepper flakes
0	At the end of cooking , I add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dishHighly recommend
0	I tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck
0	It is so goodadd a few herbs and it 's a great side dish , or add more and make a pasta type saladso very good
0	I am hooked
0	Great flavor and so easy to prepare
0	The package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions
0	It was mushy and tastelessWe have thrown out the rest of the container
0	How can I compare other items online or in a store
0	Sometimes with flavored coffees , the smell is there but the taste is n't
0	However , not with this one
0	I 'm now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try
0	I love this coffee
0	But it 's worth it
0	Many flavored coffees I 've tried only seem to have a flavored odor that does n't reach the coffee , but this one manages both
0	I 've been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it
0	It 's a no brainer
0	It is hot
0	I love it , tasty and a little sweet
0	I usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot , but this one lives up to its billing
0	It 's hot enough that people who are n't used to it will say That 's hot
0	br br Flavor bright and forward
0	This salsa is much brighter in the mouth
0	To get a good deal you have to watch for sales
0	Love this product
0	Fast shipping , as usual
0	Would buy again
0	These individually wrapped pieces are delicious although I wish there were a few more
0	Mildly sweet with no sugarfree aftertaste , even a traditional marzipanaholic should enjoy these
0	I was amazed at how quickly it arrived
0	It is a cute stocking stuffer , but only OK as far as user appeal
0	Toy was typical quality I expected
0	I got taken for a major ride on the shipping
0	So we cancelled the order
0	It was cancelled without any problem
0	That is a positive note
0	i love the convenience of the singles
0	The best creamer aroundTaste is just like the big bottle
0	These creamers come in 4 packs of 25
0	I have taken one to work and opened one for home so far , and have n't found a single broken or leaking creamer yet
0	We had no problem with the shipment , but the creamer itself is thinner than International Delight
0	Other than that we are happy D
0	Besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers , I liked this item specifically because of packaging
0	The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each as shown in the photo those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes
0	Thus , none of my cups were broken , no waste and no sloppy drippy mess
0	As a bonus , the auto delivery price is very reasonable
0	This seller is very nice
0	And the price is very good
0	I purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee tea bags
0	I received the items in a timely manner
0	Upon receipt , I removed a pack to consume
0	The poptart was STALE and left an awful taste in my mouth
0	Fantastic for after school snacks , lunch boxes , and school treats
0	The only challenge is finding more in stores
0	Way to go Kellogg 's   fantastic product
0	Yes , I am having a cup right now
0	Highly recommend
0	Taste like it is stale
0	Will not order this again
0	This stuff tasted NOTHING , like the Douwe Egberts at the hall
0	This is possibly stale coffee
0	Serveice delivery with the seller was excellent
0	The product was not
0	Will not order again
0	Bad taste
0	Iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes
0	This is honestly THE BEST seasoning salt in all the land
0	It tightens up any dish not spicy , just perfectly seasoned
0	It 's perfect , hence , my purchase of this 35 oz
0	mamma jamma
0	The order arrived as advertised
0	I have had only a few chances to use it , but it is awesome
0	The flavor is exactly what I hoped for
0	I like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly
0	Great quality , flavor and aroma
0	Ca n't beat that its organic
0	I would n't hesitate to buy this again
0	I have a slightly different version of this   different brand
0	That works pretty well
0	What a GREAT idea
0	br Absolutely recommend it
0	This product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned
0	It worked great for this , as well as for the food
0	I did n't like bananas in it thoughimpossible to get clean
0	The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out
0	Granted , some foods are more difficult than others and some do n't cause that much of a problem
0	The Munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product , it 's kind of like sucking on food through a cloth
0	This product is amazing
0	Super easy to clean and use
0	When ordering these , I was under the impression that there were 2 per packageFYIthey're not
0	Only one per
0	I literally had to hide the box to the wedding
0	It was a great tasting product for the lowest price I 've seen
0	These are delicious
0	The chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose
0	Crunchy and not bitter
0	a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB00067AD4UChocolate Covered Espresso Beans 5 Poundsa
0	The product was exactly as advertised and fresh
0	We need to reorder to keep up with demand
0	These chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful
0	The chocolate is very dark and rich and the bean inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing
0	Popchips are so good
0	These Popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence
0	They taste so good ,
0	I 've purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix which is a great product , by the way
0	This is the highest price I 've seen
0	For a twopack they should be charging 20 or less
0	What gives
0	The Sugar was sweet , that can not be denied
0	As advertised , It did n't melt when baked either
0	However , it will not do for your Liege WafflesGaufres what the larger pebbles of Belgian pearl will do
0	These grains are smaller , think pretzel salt , or seed pearls
0	That 's exactly what I was looking for to bake some chouquettes puffs with small sugar pearls on top
0	Works great , yum
0	
0	This is what I was looking for and was missing it
0	Definitely recommend it
0	A common problem in some fruit wines
0	br br This is , indeed , good strawberry flavor
0	Great stuff and dependable , especially when there are a million brands out there to choose from
0	I love the stuff
0	But I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again
0	No bite , no after taste , a little pricy but still worth it
0	No worse price wise than starbucks or peets
0	Will keep running through the list here and see what happens
0	Love them all so far
0	The taste is clean and strong , the ethos is correct organic , baby and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate
0	Be still my caffeinated heart
0	Er , Weaver 's
0	A very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream andor honey
0	Definately not my cup of coffee
0	Oh , did i say it was bitter
0	I m learning that Latin American and South American coffees have this distinct coffee caramelish finish
0	
0	These are my favorite bars ever
0	The combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful
0	Very filling
0	These are hard to find in the stores
0	I 'm thankful for subsrcibe and save
0	Chocolate , peanuts and raisinsit does n't get any better
0	Hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school
0	He takes two bars now and is very happy to do so
0	It is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores
0	So again , Amazoncom came through with a reasonable price
0	I often like to have a bar in the evening as a night snack
0	I was suprised that it was a single box
0	every time I ordered before it was a 2 pack
0	My fault for not reading closer
0	I will not order any more at this price for 1 24 count
0	Almost
0	Very smooth flavor
0	Not too strong and not too weak
0	This soup is just so full bodied , and is seasoned just right
0	Oh my gosh , is this good
0	Then Hubby brought a jar of this home
0	The tomato flavor is amazing
0	I will never buy store ketchup every again
0	Sir Kensington 's did a great job of updating the classic ketchup with this wonderful product
0	This is ridiculous
0	The best gourmet ketchup I have ever tasted
0	It is pricey , but wowlove this stuff
0	It would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup
0	Yummy
0	The tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor
0	It is clean and really fresh
0	Perfect on an avocado chicken sandwichbr br The spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup I have ever tried
0	The spicy version of this ketchup is n't bad , but it is too expensive
0	The regular version is sweet as dessert
0	Horrible
0	Annie 's Organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less
0	Even Heinz organic is a better deal
0	I gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass , not plastic
0	These condiments are overpriced and terrible
0	The classic is disgustingly sweet
0	The spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant
0	I was pretty pleased with these mushrooms
0	They were mostly large pieces , rehydrated well and had good flavor
0	I 'd estimate about 25 of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces , most likely due to the shaking about in transit
0	Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes
0	There was a small amount perhaps an ounce or so of very smallmincedsizedustlike pieces
0	Still useful to add into gravies and the like
0	Nothing gets wastedbr br The label says it is a product of China and Italy
0	Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each countrybr br I 'm quite fond of dried mushrooms
0	Really helps meld all the flavors together
0	I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta
0	Highly recommend
0	Much larger than cocktail peanuts
0	
0	The cashews were nice and big , with the vast majority being whole
0	There were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag , but that 's pretty expected with so many cashews
0	Although there were several shriveled ones , they taste just fine
0	I ordered these after a fair bit of searching online   even ordering the smaller 13 oz bags
0	The cashews were fresh and whole   with like 10 broken pieces
0	These nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty
0	They are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can
0	Plus , he likes nuts , pecans , almonds peanuts
0	He loved these
0	ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST
0	
0	Got this free with another order I placed
0	I could n't believe how much the cats loved it
0	I will buy again for sure
0	This is a great ham soup base
0	Great flavor
0	I have n't used the ham base
0	It is loaded with MSG
0	This is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture
0	Thanks again amazon
0	It tastes great , cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make
0	Although it can be made using water , I think it 's better made with milk
0	I love it with pure organic maple syrup
0	The pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my son 's egg allergy
0	It 's also great for camping or any time you 'd like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available
0	HEY
0	These are GREAT Waffles and Pancakes
0	We have to add 50 more mix , tho , as the recipies on the bag are VERY thin
0	This mix is 70 ORGANIC , too
0	Customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product
0	This mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping
0	Nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box
0	3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top
0	There were no tears in the packages
0	Just awful
0	I thought food was supposed to taste good
0	Perhaps the worst bottle of wine I 've ever had
0	It is thin , no body , and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot
0	The taste is just bitter   not the complexity that I expect from a pinot noir of any price
0	Just not what I 'm looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir
0	Maybe my bottle was n't sealed well and went to vinegar   other reviews for this wine are favorable
0	A good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition
0	Everyone get the munchiesis this is a good alternative to eating potato chips
0	This is a wonderful warm flavored tea , especially now in colder weatherbr This tea has a sweet , soothing chamomile fragrance
0	This is one of the best mint chocolate syrup I 've ever had so far
0	The others pale in flavor by comparison
0	There are only seven ingredients in this sauce , including organic natural mint flavor
0	There are only 110 calories
0	This is a simple product and it is simply good
0	It is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup , so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out
0	This will be great for people who like mint , it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate
0	Sometimes simple is better
0	A grande item
0	Delicious fish with the ultimate flavor , best ever in a can for all purposes
0	The Raincoast Trading Co salmon is very tasty , equally as good quality salmon as the Kirkland
0	However , the Raincoast arrived in perfect condition , the Kirkland cans were dented badly
0	I recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon
0	This tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an Indian restaurant
0	It 's much better than getting a teabag and making it the English way , with a lot of water and a bit of milk
0	This is very creamy and tasty
0	My only criticism is that there are n't enough sachets in the box
0	Only 10
0	That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea
0	But it 's a delicious afterdinner drink
0	I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box
0	i love this product ca nt find it locally
0	This is the best way to cook a roast
0	Please continue to keep this product available
0	It 's always a pleasure to find French 's products on the web
0	These are the best
0	Side note shipping was very slow , but maybe your chances will be better
0	But out of the can ready mix with a little salt , pepper , spinach , and some cheese and it 's a great easy meal
0	The thing about Marmite is that those who do n't like it hate it , and those who love it ca n't live without it
0	It 's very much an English thing and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor as in Victoria Beckham is Marmite meaning that those who do n't like heretc
0	Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price
0	Good job , Amazon
0	A vile , miserable pancake
0	I do n't know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste
0	Only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix
0	The buttermilk , baking soda SLS and sea salt are not
0	This one went straight into the garbage
0	What s there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie
0	Hope these do n't go the way of the dinosaur
0	These arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap
0	The cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients
0	The chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing
0	These are truly great cookies
0	That 's what I heard , at least , from an admittedly unreliable person
0	Extremely dry and hard
0	These chips have a great loaded potato flavor , which are flavorful
0	I like the sweet onion chips better , but these are also at the top of the list for greattasting potato chips
0	Kettle chips are great chips fthe money
0	I buy mostly for vending , so the size of the bag is important
0	Kettle 's 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full
0	Salt   Vinegar flavor is satisfying , about an 8 out of 10
0	Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full
0	It 's hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well
0	Sometimes they are too wide
0	or too plump with air
0	Bag size is good
0	BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10
0	There 's only a slight taste of jalapeno , and they are delicious
0	See you at addicts anonymous
0	The title says it all
0	Great flavor , hint of spice , excellent crunch
0	
0	WOW
0	I now have a FAVORITE
0	If you like onions , this is a MUST buy
0	The flavor is GREAT
0	The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in
0	I love that these are n't filled with nasty chemicals
0	While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better
0	The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches , or handing out in gift bags , even just for portion control
0	Now , I have n't done a sidebyside comparison , but these chips still taste like the real deal
0	These snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store I work for
0	Portion control AND reduced fat
0	Yes , please
0	With the Subscribe   Save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store
0	I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon 11 WHAT
0	These chips are thick and crunchy
0	The taste is perfect
0	I enjoy these chips
0	I think those are better but only slightly , like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering
0	The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag
0	The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags
0	The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor
0	These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I 've had
0	These are my favorite glutenfree dairyfree flavored chips
0	Many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so it 's nice to find ones that I can eat
0	The vinegar flavor is really intense and good
0	The ingredients listed include garlic powder , onion powder , parsley , jalapeno , and spices
0	I 'm not sure what other spices there are , but it sure tastes like lemongrass to meyum
0	These chips are thick cut and very crunch
0	They come in a seriously heavyduty bag
0	The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic
0	I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it
0	Sure enough , there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions tear here
0	So easy
0	Why did n't I think of that
0	The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese presumably some folks like this
0	They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods
0	The flavors are pure and real
0	They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive
0	Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip
0	I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste
0	Just set a limit of 1 bagbr br Consbr As another reviewer said , there 's a lot of oil in them chips
0	Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off
0	It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off , but it 's true
0	And at least this way , you 'll get rid of some of the oil
0	These are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many , a handful or two does the trick
0	Very crisp and savory
0	On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase
0	The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven
0	Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain
0	This is n't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and does n't ruin the bag at allbr br Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic
0	Tried many varieties of BBQ chips and hands down these are the BEST on the market
0	These R not too salty or greasy
0	Great crispy crunch
0	Plenty of good BBQ flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of
0	Every bag after bag is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st
0	
0	Kettle chis are the best ever
0	These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste
0	Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning
0	I like the 2 oz size bags , just the right amount of chips
0	The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh   no chip clip neededbr br The only problem
0	Definitely have to hide the case from the kids
0	OK , I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful
0	I love the crunch , the color , NO TRANS FAT
0	This was the best deal ever
0	The delivery was fast , the chips are delicious and very fresh
0	Love it
0	Personally I think the flavor is perfect
0	Try them for yourself
0	The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect
0	Just spicy enough , a hint of sweetness , just a little smokey
0	The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial , but not hard
0	This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers , hot dogs or brats , chicken or just about any casual entree
0	I 've found that going beyond the simplyflavored chips , like cheddar or vinegar , usually results in disappointment
0	The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate
0	The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chipsweet , salty , spicy
0	Was sour in there too
0	I do n't know , but this is a wellmade wellbalanced chip that is addicting
0	Rich taste and flavor
0	Almost impossible not to finish the entire bagThe true meaning of decadence
0	These are certainly my favorite chips
0	Oh , I love these chips
0	Great that these are so cheap here at Amazon
0	I LOVE these chips
0	It is a little weird to review potato chips
0	But these chips are great
0	The crunch is just right , plus they have just the right amount of salt
0	Not to salty not too bland
0	They are a little oily but that 's ok
0	The best thing is the 2 oz package
0	This 2 oz package allows for a little portion control
0	Be sure to use your scissors to open , 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and do n't open easily
0	Enjoy
0	Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors
0	All in all , its good to have choiceAmazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice
0	these chips are good , and bad , and create moral dilemmas constantly
0	BEWARE
0	Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss
0	Some of their flavors are terrible
0	But this is very simple and delicious
0	Probably one of their best flavorsbr br Pros Thick , crunchy potato chips with light salt that does n't compromise on taste , ecofriendly business that is n't just giving us lip servicebr br Cons The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open
0	Use scissors instead
0	They are a bit spicy , but nothing overpowering
0	Just lots of crunchy , sweet , spicy goodness
0	It 's crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt
0	Just perfect
0	But this one
0	I just keep on eating
0	These are some of the best chips that I have ever had
0	They are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time
0	Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands
0	Kettle Brand chips do n't have trans fats , MSG or artificial flavors and colorings
0	These chips are spicy , so you would want to select a semisweet white wine
0	Also , a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger , lime , garlic and cilantro without overpowering them
0	Classically , a Germanstyle Riesling fits these parameters perfectly
0	These Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty , tangy , sweet and crunchy

0	Classically , a Germanstyle Riesling fits these parameters perfectly
0	I have to use a knife or scissors everytime
0	These are delicious
0	The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches , definitely more than a serving
0	I recently tried this flavorbrand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are
0	I am a little disappointed that there are not , so far , very many brown chips in these bags , but the flavor is still very good
0	They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag
0	Chips are never crushed or broken , always fresh
0	We really liked this brandflavor of chips
0	Very tasty
0	These chips are some of the best I 've tasted
0	They are not filled with chemicals
0	You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato
0	Not greasy
0	Perfectly crispy
0	If you do n't like salt and vinegar tanginess , do n't even bother to try
0	These definitely have zip
0	These chips were a great deal
0	Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips
0	Shipping was very fast , sooner than expected
0	Eat at your own risk
0	Good and salty
0	Great buy and arrived quick and packed great
0	I love brown russet , hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee
0	  My experience with a lot of cheesefavored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side
0	Bought this box of chips as a Father 's Day gift because Dad loves them
0	They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips
0	These chips are quite tasty and the price is right
0	Packaged very well , would buy again
0	So I do n't know why these were differentbr Will never buy these chips from here again
0	They are very good chips
0	Amazon should rethink the shipping to Alaska thing
0	I would order groceries online
0	My husband likes these a lot
0	Not bad , though
0	Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health
0	They do have about 12 the calories in fat , however
0	Just got this order and it is ok A bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me , if it is there
0	There is very little sour cream or onion flavor
0	Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning
0	The flavoring included Parmesan , Cheddar , Blue Cheese , garlic and other spices
0	As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get
0	These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming
0	The flavoring included garlic , ginger , jalapeno , cilantro and other spices , and it just felt great to eat these
0	I will buy these again
0	These were a treat
0	I agree with the other review , these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums
0	The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the saltvinegar combo
0	Unfortunately , every bag I received in that case was over cooked
0	They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag
0	They definitely need to improve that
0	We have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery
0	
0	
0	
0	and I do not even like kettle chips
0	For the most part , I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy , but the flavor of these chips is amazing
0	The are the type of hot that is refreshing
0	If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things
0	
0	
0	These are the best potato chips I 've ever tasted
0	It 's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping
0	The texturecrunchiness is just perfect , as is the salt and vinegar combination
0	And , judging from the nutrition facts , they seem to be healthier , too
0	they are really amazing
0	i love cheddar too , but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor
0	This is easily the best potato chip that I have ever had
0	Look at the ingredients Ginger and 3 types of hot pepper
0	They have that hotwithahintofsweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of Thai food
0	Since these are kettlecooked , the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit overbrowned
0	The flavor is tremendous , although I would n't describe it as Thai
0	It 's more of a vague , sweet and tangy flavor with a kick , and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger
0	The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher 's snack cupboard
0	That makes them an indulgence thatbr rescues some people from overindulgence
0	Every flavor is dynamite
0	And they 're healthy
0	Enjoy , and do n't eat them too fast
0	Wo n't order this brand again
0	Great chips otherwise
0	Perfect
0	These chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip , but whose taste buds do n't appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor
0	The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips along with the rest of the flavors is that the serving size is HALF the bag
0	Really
0	Who can eat half and save the rest for later
0	Not me
0	These are a favorite at our home
0	These are not ruffly chips that have ridges
0	These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes
0	They also have a great taste
0	These are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many
0	They have the best potato flavor
0	Great chips , great price
0	They are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own
0	Mmmmm vinegar
0	Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot
0	And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful
0	It tastes like rancid milk
0	Not just sour , but like sour cream that when rancid
0	The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing
0	I basically hated these chips
0	Hopefully they 'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips
0	Kettle chips now look , feel and taste like Lays
0	These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty
0	Now , no longer my favorite
0	Great price for an excellent chip
0	At about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip
0	The chips taste great , and packages were all sealed and in good condition when the arrived
0	The box on the other hand was in tatters , with holes and complely squished
0	I do n't know if that was a result of customs or the voyage , but to receive it was a bit disgruntling given it was falling apart
0	Luckily , there were no victims within
0	All the chips are as they should be
0	Not my taste
0	Make sure you like salt   vinegar before ordering
0	I 'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips
0	TOTALLY ORGASMIC
0	these chips are the best spicy chip i have ever tasted
0	signed up for the subscribe and save option
0	the case contained 15FIFTEEN , FULL SIZED BAGS OF CHIPS
0	the price per unit equals 173 per package
0	that is not even the cost of plain chips
0	if you add the free shipping and the fast delivery , this deal is a steal
0	ps
0	ENJOY
0	Seriously , now
0	Tasty , tasty , tasty
0	Fresh , toobr br The only problem is that you have a pack of 24 and that can lend itself to wanting to make multiple trips to the cupboard for more helpings
0	Or , grabbing multiple bags to begin with
0	Pace yourself
0	It 's really a good size for an adultbr br It 's a somewhat healthier snack than a typical bag of fried chips , but it has 300 calories per bag
0	Again , not too bad , but something to think aboutbr br Bottomline Delicious
0	Despite coming in an extremely large box , I found this to be great value
0	All the bags were preserved with a reasonable expiration date that is months away
0	I 'd definitely recommend
0	Give me pain chips any day
0	Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips
0	They 're also crunchy , as kettlecooked chips should be
0	THOSE are awesome
0	Being a saltfree product is why I purchased this , but the chips are quite greasy
0	These are the best potato chips that money can buy
0	There is just enough salt to taste it , but not so much that it masks the lingering potatoey awesomeness after you 've wolfed down a bag of these beauties
0	I may never eat anything else again
0	These things are just too darn cheesy
0	Otherwise , you will overdose on their cheddary goodness
0	I tried to create an original line to describe this palatepleasing taste treat , but could n't beat what the manufacturer said tonguepuckering tang and crunch
0	For the sake of fewer calories , I try hard and have succeeded so far
0	You do n't need salt to hide the taste of potato chips
0	And these chips prove it
0	The taste of the potato comes through , instead of being masked
0	They are not actually burned
0	It has something to do with how much sugar is in the potato that makes it dark
0	These are the best of the best
0	I have tried a lot of SV chips and these are the best
0	Real sea salt and REAL vinegar
0	Mouthwatering flavor   crispiness
0	Not for the faint of heart   the flavor is very authentic
0	
0	Kettle brand chips are very crunchy
0	I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the soft end of the softcrunchy spectrum
0	Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest , but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy
0	Otherwise , you 'll love these chips
0	The Sea Salt   Vinegar chips are super TANGY
0	I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time
0	Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt   Vinegar has a gourmet flavor
0	The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy
0	I do n't know how else to put it
0	I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product
0	Did I just get a weird batch
0	Well the next bag was good
0	So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle
0	Acquire company with high quality brand recognition , sell product to mass merchants , lower qualitycost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand
0	increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors
0	Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand
0	Truly delicious
0	These Backyard BBQ Kettle Chips were a great deal with the promo code
0	It was nice to have a larger size bag
0	Great flavor and All Natural
0	Total calories is 300 for 2 ounce bag
0	This is slightly on the higher side
0	But still it is ok , as they have not compromised on the tastebr br Only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips , which taste bad
0	Kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are therebr br Thanks to Amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon
0	Chips are not as tangy as I hoped or expected
0	Poore Brothers is a better choice for the hardcore Salt N Vinegar fans
0	These bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces
0	also felt very greasy
0	Had to keep wiping my fingers on a napkin
0	Got these Kettle Chips Sea Salt   Vinegar 15 5 oz bags and was not impressed
0	Tasted kind of flat
0	Some bags had multiple holes
0	One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it
0	So much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired
0	Martin
0	But without any of the associated wardrobe risks
0	  HIGHLY recommended
0	Hard rather than crispy , are much thinner than they used to be and lacking any flavour , a real shame
0	completely plain and gross
0	how does this even happen
0	Amazon , in it 's deep wisdom , has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE , and other brands of
0	potato chips , TOGETHERbr br Of course , this DOES have SOME advantages , because most potatochip lovers , like me
0	, enjoy eating several flavour , and brand varieties
0	So , comparisons can be made easily
0	At least they are in the oneounce bagshopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same
0	These are definitely chips for ADULTS , however   andor children whose strongerthanadult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips
0	br br The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS , in the 1ounce bags , and hopefully , in the 9 ounce bags as well , is as followsbr br Potatoesbr Vegetable Oil , Safflower and Sunflower Oil , br Honey Powder , Dried cane sugar , honey , br Rice Powderbr Sugarbr Saltbr Onion Powderbr Tomato Powderbr Paprikabr Torula Yeastbr Garlic Powderbr Chili Pepperbr Citric Acidbr Cayenne Pepperbr Paprika Oleoresin , Colourbr Natural Smoke Flavourbr br Naturally cooked , natural ingredients
0	The combination is a true taste treatbr br Of course , as with all ptato chips , moderation is the keybr Potatoes contain a LOT of potassiumwhich gives energy and othr good thingsbut too much of which can damage kindneys
0	The vegetable oil is great   but too much oil , as well as too much starch , from the potatoes , can hurt the eyes
0	Natural smoke flavour is SO yummybut it , as well as sugar , has   in very large amounts   been linked to cancer productionbr br As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go , thisbr can be ameliorated , a bit , by drinking TEAwhich is good for the eyes
0	  br br These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE , br are totally scrumptious
0	These chips are okay
0	Personally , I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange
0	Keeps you from eating too many
0	Unedible
0	Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case , not expired but stale and unedible just the same
0	These chips are VERY GOOD
0	Kettle Brand chips used to be so goodoily , crunchy , flavorful
0	I suspect the company has been bought out and the recipe has been changed for the worse
0	Now they 're no better than any other big name brand chip
0	Try the Good Health Kettle Style Olive Oil chips instead
0	RIP , Kettle Brand chips
0	
0	you can absolutely forget about these
0	Confirmed by other reviewers , these chips are now total garbage
0	Like chewing on styrofoam packaging peanuts
0	Positively awful , no hyperbole or exaggeration
0	From a reportedly once great premium brand , literally any mass market chip I 've ever tried tastes better than these
0	Stale and rancid tasting , and virtually no salty taste whatsoever
0	Completely awful
0	These chips are nasty
0	I thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag , no the chips were just soaked with grease
0	Nasty
0	
0	The brown chips are especially bad , besides being salty and sour , they also taste overcooked and burnt
0	But normal people , please do not try this at home
0	I have no argument on this
0	But the point is that more than 50 in the bag is overfried and in brown color
0	I really suffer eating the overfried chips
0	I open some other bags and it looks like the same
0	But for sure I will never buy this brand any more
0	Have not found baked no salt potato chips anywhere
0	If there are any I wish someone would post
0	These are better in England
0	I do n't know why
0	Maybe it 's just nostalgia on my part
0	However , many , many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil
0	I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands
0	It was very unappetizing , and who wants all that oil
0	Very mild in comparison to many others
0	The best of the best are HEB storebrand and World Market
0	Bob 's and Zapp 's Are n't bad
0	These chips are greasy and taste burntthere is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it especially at the bottom of the bag
0	I bought a case of these , and a case of the cheddar and sour cream
0	Both cases ended up in the garbage can
0	Kettle 's are darkburnt , more broken bits , taste greasyoily and not the light crunch
0	Oh well
0	Too strong sour taste and even when you open the bag , the sour smell is too strong
0	I do n't like it
0	Unless you really really really like vinegar   AVOID
0	Those chips should have been called Vinegar and Sea Salt   not Sea Salt and Vinegar
0	I would definitely make the purchase again
0	Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time
0	Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage , a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label yeast extract
0	The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancidbr br What a shame , no more kettle chips for me
0	It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method
0	Do nt be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore
0	The chips were greatfor the first few bags
0	However , after the first bag or two , I noticed that the remaining bags were damaged
0	There were holes in each bag and black , sticky stains on the outside
0	But someone somewhere screwed up
0	These chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag
0	Now
0	It 's like a game of roulette
0	Do n't know if it is still in the box , but it is outside on the porch
0	The outside Amazon box was intact , so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse , do n't know which
0	Kettle Chips are the best potato chip God has ever invented
0	Get your life back   with Kettle Chips
0	My daughter that has autism craves hot , spice and pungent foods
0	These are her absolute favorite chips
0	I am a great fan of potato chips and of Thai food
0	What a concept These chips are spicy enough , without burning a hole in your tongue
0	Once in a while , this is a treat definitely worth indulging in
0	Terrible
0	I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box , gross
0	And the box is filled with grease stains
0	Idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here , but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper
0	I 'm very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers can not enjoy now
0	No worries here
0	All bags are in great shape and expiration dates are n't until June
0	Chips , at least from the first bag , taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world
0	By the way , fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so , yay team
0	I want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then
0	But , after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips , these just do n't hit the spot for me
0	The box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs
0	Most of the bags survived in tact
0	These chips taste awesome
0	And unlike most other flavored chips , they actually make sure that plenty of the flavory salty goodness gets on each individual chip
0	Just do n't pass gas near any pretty ladies after consumption
0	With Kettle Chips , you really have to be careful
0	Some of their flavors are nauseating
0	Thick cuts of potato , fried to a dark golden brown
0	They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt
0	I ca n't recommend these chips enough
0	During cooking , the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize , creating chips from light gold to a deep amber
0	The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors , and an artisanal display in every bagbr br Some have also said that these chips are oily , which is true
0	Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way
0	That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being usedbr br You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor
0	I 'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips
0	Period
0	These are among the best chips I have ever eaten
0	I was hooked
0	br br You get a pretty big box , filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels
0	You 've got to stick with this blue bag of chips
0	Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands
0	Kettle Brand chips do n't have trans fats , MSG or artificial flavors and colorings
0	These chips are spicy , so you would want to select a semisweet white wine
0	Also , a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger , lime , garlic and cilantro without overpowering them
0	Classically , a Germanstyle Riesling fits these parameters perfectly
0	Nice crispy thick chips
0	They are just like regular potatoe chips
0	
0	I 've found a new taste treat
0	The processing   ingredients list is actually pretty goodno trans fats , etc
0	So , if you want an indulgence , these are A
0	They are much more flavorful
0	Never had a honeydijon potato chip before
0	Incredibly good   a flavorful combination of sweet , tangy , salty
0	Also not overly hot or spicy
0	Excellentbr br If you want a snack , have something REALLY good
0	It 's got to be worth the caloriesand these are
0	This is a real good productI love these chips and so does my customers ca n't go wrong wit these the best
0	These are the only chips I eat
0	I do n't know what to say that others have not covered
0	Only 5 mg sodium per serving , chips are crisp
0	I sometimes will dip in a low salt ketchup and that adds a bit to the flavor
0	They are crisp and tasty without all of the salt
0	First off , these chips are not super spicy
0	They actually taste sort of sweet at first , with many degrees of flavor
0	The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards
0	I 'd say these are definitely a good , unique chip
0	Smiles
0	I almost gave up on finding a potato chip like this
0	It 's slightly hardcrunchy , but not a problem at all
0	I would just prefer it to be softer
0	Kettle if you do make that happen , please keep everything else the same
0	Thank you
0	In a way , they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen , but with a kick
0	For me , how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger
0	Because this is a case purchase , I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case
0	The 2 oz size seems to be no longer available , which is a shame I can eat the entire 5 oz bag
0	These are by far the best
0	They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste
0	Package arrived DOUBLE boxed , wrapped , and the inside boxthat holds the goods perfect not a single dent or rough mark , outstanding packagingbr br The Productbr br These are the best chips on the planet , Salt ' N Vinegar flavor is beyond among the best chips I 've ever had
0	But try it againbr br Not to mention , this particular flavor has held up in numerous surveys and comparisons against other manufactures
0	than many other chips , as one peruses the dietary informationbr br Second , individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at thembr br Third , the jalapeno has some kick not overly hot , of course
0	Too many products labelled as spicy are not , have no kick , and are as bland as can be
0	Here , you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno
0	My preference
0	A bit more heat
0

0	
0	After looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box , I had to write a review
0	The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag
0	Thanks for a great tasting product , good price and quick shipping
0	I 'll buy these againsoon
0	There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips
0	One bag has a lot , I generally can not finish it by myself
0	The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me
0	How convenient
0	The Kettle chips were in a 2 oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal
0	The chips are so delicious , baked not fried and lightly salted with Sea Salt
0	What more could you ask for in a great tasting chip
0	How to achieve potato chip nirvana
0	But you will enjoy ever step
0	Damn it
0	Tastes awesome though
0	
0	These are the best spicy chips I have ever had the pleasure of eating
0	They are fantastic
0	Got my case right here , and loving every bite
0	Lays ai nt got nothin on Kettle Brand
0	
0	I have never enjoyed unsalted potato chips before these
0	They have a natural potato flavor with thick , crunchy chips
0	The only bad thing is the bag is a pain to open
0	Use scissors and save yourself the aggravation
0	I especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch
0	These 2 oz bags are perfect for anyone who has a problem controlling portions like me
0	
0	Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands
0	Kettle Brand chips do n't have trans fats , MSG or artificial flavors and colorings
0	The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosherbr br Annette Solomon , a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with Spicy Thai chips
0	These chips are spicy , so you would want to select a semisweet white wine
0	Also , a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger , lime , garlic and cilantro without overpowering them
0	Classically , a Germanstyle Riesling fits these parameters perfectly
0	The Honey Dijon chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans , coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat
0	Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands
0	Kettle Brand chips do n't have trans fats , MSG or artificial flavors and colorings
0	These chips are spicy , so you would want to select a semisweet white wine
0	Also , a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger , lime , garlic and cilantro without overpowering them
0	Classically , a Germanstyle Riesling fits these parameters perfectly
0	Kettle chips are thicker and crunchier though greasier at times than other chips , and the honey dijon flavor is great
0	They do n't have the overwhelming salty taste some cheaper chips have , and the 2 oz size is great for an adult size snack
0	Not with these , the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and does nt stop until you 've finished the bag
0	These are very addictive
0	If you like salt and vinegar , these are the ultimate chips
0	Nothing else compares
0	Tasted good
0	Spicy
0	Those that do n't like spicy should stay away from this
0	For the price paid , very good buy
0	These are seriously delicious , especially if you like plain potato chips
0	Need scissors
0	there 's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves
0	I suggest a blotshake on some paper towels before consuming
0	Either way , they have a yummy potato taste , and very satisfying crunch
0	Delicious
0	This bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool , such as scissors , do n't even try without scissorsbr br They are crispy and taste like chips that are n't advertised as being salted
0	Kettle Foods , Inc is a Green Giant , a company highlighted for their environmental practices
0	They convert waste oils to biodiesel to power some of their company cars
0	Not only are their efforts for the future but they care for the present by rejuvenate a neighboring 2 acre wetland ecosystem
0	These really are amazing chips
0	Do n't be put off by one of the cheeses being blue cheeseit is so subtle that even blue cheese haters like mewill enjoy these
0	These chips are delectably delicious
0	I am on a low sodium diet
0	There is just a kiss worth on a chip , but beleive me , it is a total makeout
0	
0	Not too salty like regular supermarket chips , this is a snack that will not overwhelm you with guilt
0	I agree with the company motto A Natural Obsession
0	I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent
0	The flavor of these is very strong , so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor , like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread
0	Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food
0	These are flavorful and crunchy and will make your mouth happy
0	These are my new favorite
0	I would have given the product 5 stars easily had it not been for the price
0	The taste is fabulous   you wo n't be disappointed
0	These chips were good
0	these are the best chips out there nothing can beat this taste
0	
0	At first I was thinking , cheese flavored chips
0	The herbs they used are just delicious
0	The cheese is not overpowering
0	They are yummy and crispy
0	
0	The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market
0	However , Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used , with ginger being the most important that is now missing
0	Notice that they removed ginger with attitude from the bag
0	Sadly , the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me
0	Way to ruin a great thing
0	Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste
0	Wo n't order againbr br EDIT And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it , black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat
0	The chips are tangy and crunchy and satisfy your potato chip fix like no other brand
0	and THAT is the problem
0	I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price
0	Well being used to the cheaper chips I was n't expecting how mellow these things are
0	So , for the price and how many you get , these chips are definately worth it
0	I recommend these , 4 stars
0	I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to bootbr br   How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt
0	For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips , this is the one to choose
0	The flavor is zippy and tart , with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less natural versions of this snack
0	The 2ounce bags are just right to share at lunch
0	I do n't care for the fancy flavors and these are salted just right
0	These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a low salt item
0	By comparison , Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy
0	Fantastic tasting potato chips
0	I love the individual bags , great for kids and adults too
0	The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips
0	The bags are very strong   much thicker than , say , Lay 's potato chip bags
0	Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips , salted just right
0	Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion , some are cooked more than others , which gives it a more authentic , nonmanufactured feel
0	Great quality and much cheaper than in the stores
0	Will definitely be buying more
0	Yes , they are good
0	However , they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff , which is initially satisfying then becomes too much
0	And certainly is n't good for the waistline or general nutritional issuesbr br AND the package ca n't be opened without a sharp implement
0	I do n't normally carry a knife or scissors and do n't have rodent teeth
0	Even then , the bag was wow thick and toughbr br On the package it says these are Krinkle Cut chips
0	Turns out that means the corrugated kind , not what I wanted
0	So this information is importantbr br These are good but so are other brands with which I do n't have these problems
0	Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available
0	On the minus side , a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it
0	Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy
0	What 's wrong with simply light and crispy
0	This kettle chips taste Good , Crispy   Crunchy   too
0	U will enjoy it also
0	Moreover , it 's thinly cut   sliced
0	I really like the balance in the flavor
0	Definitely recommend it for fans of Earl Grey with a kick
0	I have a cup every morning , very smooth refreshing tea
0	The price is very competitive
0	I have ordered it a number of times , and each batch is consistently excellent
0	I have even given it as a gift , as its container is superb for keeping loose tea fresh
0	The metal canister has an inner lid that is lifted with its own attached knob , so the tea stays dry and fresh for the length of time it takes to use it up
0	These biscuits are delicious , not too sweet , with just enough crunch
0	Quick delivery
0	Very satisfied
0	Excellent , lofat , lo calorie treat for dogs
0	I was desperate to find a treat that would measure up
0	He gets one heartshaped biscuit at bedtime
0	He sleeps in a crate
0	They are well worth the price
0	This product does a great job of clearing out the kidneys
0	Love this with a bag of shrimp 34 pound , some stir fry veges and a little onion chopped
0	Not too hot but very tasty
0	So I got this and tasted it strait out of the bottle , it tasted like smoky flavored milk   YUCK
0	I tried to doctor up the soda with a little SF Vanilla Torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream   IT TASTED AMAZING
0	I put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it , it tasted fine
0	It was such a happy accident to find out how to use it
0	When added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in creambr br It is VERY potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting , if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch
0	It tastes wonderful and is half the price of storeboughtbr br It is excellent
0	It would pop up here and there , and then disappear
0	The next day , it was gone
0	It is old fashioned drink from Michigan , since 1866 , and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character
0	If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste
0	Vernors has a strong vanilla presence , is smoother and more moist , and sweeter than a ginger ale
0	It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale , very good
0	A ginger ale is more dry , higher in carbonation , and has a spicier bite to it
0	Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can , versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale
0	Neither has caffeinebr br The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners
0	The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors
0	Many microbrews are using cane sugar again , although it costs more , to get a better taste
0	Vernor 's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years , no doubt accounting for the smoothness
0	All in all a great soda for anytime
0	That is why it sells here
0	Vernors has quite a history , and there are two books at Amazon about the soda
0	The first is Vernor 's Ginger Ale Images of America Michigan ISBN10 0738551856
0	The second book is The Vernor 's Story From Gnomes to Now ISBN10 0472066978 a book about the company 's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome , and Vernor 's fans
0	If you want to find a good flavor substitute for maple syrup , barley malt , or brown rice syrup , this will do nicely
0	However , when it was in stock , it was priced well for the 2packbr br Other than baking , I 've used it to top waffles , pancakes , and in small doses 12 teaspoon added it to oatmeal
0	Recipes with dried fruit need much less , cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F if there is oil in the recipe , cut it by 13 alternately , use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid   just do n't use too much or your recipe will be dry
0	Additionally , when baking , make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry
0	However , I highly recommend it for baking
0	Good quality nectar
0	Keeps the blood sugar stable
0	Great buy also
0	This sweetner is the best , it brings out the true flavors in what ever you add it to
0	And it has great health benefts
0	I love this stuff
0	It sweetens without affecting the blood glucose levels
0	Just kidding
0	I finally have found a natural sugar substitute that has the added benefit of having a low glycemic index
0	Agave is delicious
0	I have recommended it to many friends , and it is very economical to purchase the 46 oz bottles
0	I used to buy the Wholesome Sweetners agave and like it a little better , but switched because it became too expensive
0	So this is the cheeper option
0	I do n't like the container
0	It 's fine for the price
0	I love using this to sweeten tea , coffee , etc
0	It tastes much better than other low glycemic sweeteners   there is no bitter aftertaste
0	I ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product
0	This amber agave nectar has become our primary sweetener because of the low glycemic effect on blood sugar
0	The taste is mellow , and the sweetening power is higher than sugar so you use less , but without the twang of honey
0	I would not even look at sugar any more
0	I love this product
0	It last a long time , and is a good value
0	Madhava Agave Nectar is good tasting , it was a good buy
0	This stuff is great because it 's low glycemic
0	This size is economical and shipping is fast , too
0	Save a little money buying in larger quantities , as opposed to the smaller bottles
0	Good for pies , cereal , frozen yogurt , etc
0	This is an awesome product which I 've ordered many times
0	Honeylike flavored , lower glycemic sweetener that 's great in coffee or tea
0	Thanks again
0	I 've tried supermarkets , health food stores and wholesale clubs
0	The prices are usually around 13 for a 32 oz bottle and this is 19ish for 2x46 oz
0	Granulated sugar has only 45 calories per tablespoon
0	How could Agave Nectar be better than sugar
0	These are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat , but oompletely enjoyable
0	You finish the bag and the indside is just coated with spices
0	Great stuff
0	These are the best tasting tortilla chips I have ever had
0	There is so much flavor in these chips that I no longer miss pico de gallo
0	These potato chips are DELICIOUS
0	They are pure and void of all artificial flavorings
0	The true flavor is present , and it satisifies the need for something salty , sweet , spicy , and crunchy
0	A
0	These chips are a great snack if you do n't want all the junk assiciated with chips
0	I love these chips
0	The flavor is not plain
0	They are sweet and spicy all at the same time
0	The only drawback is it has a tad bit too much salt
0	But , it still a great flavor
0	They have a great balance of sweetness and spice
0	Very hard to find in New Jersey
0	Can not have just one bag around
0	
0	I ca n't believe how wonderful this chip is
0	The slightly spicy after taste gives the chip extra punch and flavor
0	These chips are perfect for snacking with or without salsa
0	The texture is brittle and thin , like other Plocky 's chipsbr br The only downside the spice is minimal
0	These are the best chips I have ever eaten
0	Sweet but spicy crispyreally good
0	Delivery was perfect , no crushed chips
0	Fantastic overall
0	A nice case of chips that are quite tasty
0	OH MY WORD
0	Spicy but not burning spicy , more like tonguewarming , sweetish , saltya really stronglyflavored and delicious chip
0	My bad
0	Geeshbr br Yes , 150 cals per 1 oz serving
0	That 's about par for the course for fried chipsbr br Verdict Fattening , crispy , flavorful , delicious
0	Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a lowfat sandwich or soupbr br Enjoybr br Mir
0	They are really very good
0	They taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying
0	Not with Plocky'sI always eat less and feel satisfied
0	There are actual pieces of beans in the chips and they are not overly salty like other chips
0	It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store
0	Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued
0	The one star is for the substitution
0	The country bbq is a 4 start chip , but not the chip I longed for
0	We love these chips
0	It sure is
0	Unique and different flavor and the right thicknessbr br It remains crunchy , spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat
0	There are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips
0	However , some of the spices are lacking from this chip
0	Go ahead you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese
0	Maybe some el pastor , shredded meat , tomatoes , etcetera
0	I Love these chips for its unique taste and incredible crispy texture
0	Running out of them constantly
0	These chips are the only ones I found to be tasty and healthy
0	They have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutritionthe perfect blend
0	We love these
0	Strong enough to dip in any condiment , great flavor and grain texture
0	These spicy chips have a lot of great flavor but be warned , you will be left with some stanky breath afterwards
0	Your prices are terrific too
0	Good job
0	These chips are delicious
0	For chips they are also very healthy
0	Plocky 's Red Beans and Rice Tortilla Chips are really tasty
0	No artificial stuff
0	
0	  sweet and spicy but not overwhelming just enough to work up the palate , not salty just enough to balance out the sweetness I will be ordering these again soon
0	LOVe IT
0	The service was respectable and the shipping free
0	I love this product
0	All of the different flavors are fantastic
0	My family likes the 3 grain the best
0	No more corn tortilla chips in this house
0	Love these chips , and I do n't even like black beans
0	Very tasty
0	Yum
0	Plus , good for you
0	These chips are FANFREAKINTASTIC
0	A nice sweet smoky flavor and then a little bitoheat
0	OH YA BABY
0	Nice amount of heat and smoke
0	Very tasty chip that goes great with a brew
0	These chips are salty with a hint of sweet
0	They are crisp and crunchy
0	really love , was out of stock
0	  Nancy Walsh
0	Ok
0	It wo n't last long
0	Beware
0	The texture is light and crispy , rather than thick and crunchy
0	I highly recommend these
0	WOW
0	The spicy flavor grabs you at the first bite
0	Once a bag is open , it is gone
0	We like these chips for salsa and quacomole better than any other cips on the market
0	I guess there 's no telling what will tickle the palate
0	Practically bland , in fact
0	Do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12
0	Yeast Extract is listed as an ingredient
0	Sounds harmless , right
0	Specifically , these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract , which is , on a chemical level , monosodium glutamate
0	It 's just derived from a different source , but it has all the same toxic properties
0	These were not flavorful enough for my taste
0	It seems that all the seasoning falls off the chips and sinks to the bottom of the bag
0	Too bad , because I really liked the idea of a healthier potato chip
0	I would not buy these again
0	Plocky 's chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness
0	They are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips
0	The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten
0	They hold up great to salsas and dips
0	Nothing wimpy about them
0	I just wish the company made a bigger bag
0	Love them
0	Usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery , but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty
0	Order by the case
0	My case of chips came without any packing inside
0	All bags in a box with no cushioning at all
0	A great item but if they ca n't package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money
0	I immediately ordered a case
0	These chips are light , crispy , flavorful , and good for you
0	These chips are truly amazing
0	They have it all
0	Need I say more
0	These are the most fantastic chips I 've ever had
0	I could eat the whole bag myself
0	They are great
0	We need a bigger bag
0	
0	I did not like these potatoe chips
0	It 's hot , and sweet , with an overwhelming taste of garlic
0	It 's also a bit salty
0	Long story short   these are very tasty
0	This may well help in shipping , but when paying a premium price for ' organic ' it just seems more deceptive
0	Wonderful candy , hard to find
0	I got a huge bag and put it in freezer
0	It came shipped nicely in a sturdy box and heavy plastic
0	Just great
0	
0	These lovely pastries made our Dragon Boat Festival party much more fun
0	I really like the pineapple shortcakes sold here
0	Unlike some of the massproduction pineapple shortcakes that use artificial flavoring , Tasselfield 's pineapple shortcakes use real pineapples and it makes the whole world difference
0	Immediately I was all like Oh man , this is gon na suck
0	Regardless of the quantity error though , it sure kicked some redbr br Everyone in my town absolutely loves it
0	Everyone in village loved it , of course now they are wondering when the next shipment will get it
0	Expiration date 113
0	Smashed and
0	stale
0	This cinnamon cake loaf has a wonderful natural flavor
0	It 's delicious
0	In the future , I will read more carefully
0	The package recommended stirring before use , so I gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo
0	br I tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it
0	Well , I opened it and it is grayish sticky mess
0	Which would probably end up better and cheaper
0	Oh well , live and learn
0	I am not a picky eater , especially if the item contains sugar but this was horrible
0	The consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting
0	It is not light and fluffy
0	It is very gooey
0	I can not even imagine trying to spread it on a cake   it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey
0	I did not even try it on a cake , because the taste and texture were so offputting
0	Seriously , do not waste your money
0	This product was such a disappointment
0	As all the other reviewers said , it 's a gluey , sticky texture more akin to Elmer 's Glue than to an edible food product
0	The flavor was sickening sweet
0	I actually thought that the frosting had spoiled
0	It was that bad
0	Cherrybrook cake and cookie mixes are so good
0	It 's hard to believe they even sell this
0	It stuck to the knife , ran down in strings , what a mess
0	Who would buy this mess
0	Horrible
0	Like others said , it is a glueytacky mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on
0	It reminds me of taffy that has n't quite hit the right stage in the candy making process
0	The taste is n't that great either , and it 's sickeningly sweet even for frosting
0	The only thing it might be used for is a frosting for cinnamon buns
0	I still do n't think it would be the right consistency
0	It 's kind of generous to call it frosting , it has more the consistency of rubber cement
0	Horrible experience , bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever
0	It spread about as easily as chewing gum , stuck to everything it came in contact with , and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it
0	On top of all this , it did n't even taste good
0	So we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a premade cake
0	Our cake , which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey , was used as a centerpiece
0	A really ugly centerpiece , that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried
0	Well worth the money
0	I did the calculations on different bags and this dollar amount is an excellent value
0	There are approx 2338 pops in the box
0	So far I 've been through about half the box and have found about 3 without wrappers
0	That 's pretty good considering
0	If you need 30lbs of dumdums go for this product
0	Enjoy
0	This is pretty good canned meat
0	The various meats are all pretty good quality and was enough for 3 large portions each can
0	There were n't large chunks of fat or gristle in any of the cans , which I 've experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats
0	The proportion of liquids to meat was fair too , it 's not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either , though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat
0	None of the meat was seasoned , at all
0	This is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring
0	Do n't plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats , it gave everything a slightly rancid , soury tasteno idea why
0	Due to the higher calories and higher price , I will only stock this as emergency food
0	I will buy more for that reason
0	With all that 's in it , this is a very good value
0	Considering you can pay as much for any one of the ingredients in it
0	It 's quite tasty in that it 's not too sweet , very thick textured even with the tiny bits of seed in it reminiscent of a banana smoothie
0	The ingredient list is somewhat confusing but note that only the Acerola Cherry is from concentrate , everything else is fresh pressed
0	Acai is very high on the ORAC scale of antioxidants , Rose Hips are also very high , everything else is in the mid to high range of fruit
0	Pomegranate has many beneficial properties beyond just antioxidants as well , it 's a noteworthy fighter of heart disease and Alzheimer 's type dementia
0	A watered down perversion of the acai berrybr br This juice comes on strong and harsh
0	With tart aftertaste and no texturebr br That 's because it is mostly apple juice , grape juice , pomegranate juice , blackberry juice , blueberry juice , and tart cherry juice
0	Oh yeah there is some acai berry juice mixed into this concoctionbr br You shall not find that distinctive smooth chocolaty acai flavor here
0	There is no milky mouth pleasing texture neither
0	That 's not my point
0	I 'm saying that it 's a juice blend that does not taste anything like the real acai juice
0	This product is made by Annie 's Inc in Berkely , CAmade in the USA
0	The product maintains excellent organic integrity , and it is stored in 100 recycled paperboard packagingbr br The manufacturers also support family farms   use organic milk , butter , and yogurt
0	The product takes approximately 10 min
0	to prepare
0	The product contains dairy and wheat , and it has been exposed to equipment that also processes egg and soy productsbr br The ingredients include organic whole wheat shell pasta , organic valley organic cheddar cheese organic cultured pasteurized milk , salt , nonanimal enzymes , organic whey , salt , and sodium phosphatebr br This is a mildly flavored whole wheat macaroni   cheese dinner
0	This mac and cheese is a wonderful comfort food
0	The pasta is firm , and it has an excellent flavorbr br There are no artificial flavors , synthetics colors , or preservatives
0	The pasta was produced without antibiotics , synthetic hormones , or persistent pesticidesbr br This pasta is simple to make and it has a wonderful texture
0	There are 25 servings per box 25 oz

0	2 g fat , 10 mg cholest , 570 mg sodium , 43 g carb , 5 g fiber , 6 g sugars , 9 g proteinbr br However , the cheese envelop is not exactly sufficient even when you add the butter , milk , or yogurt
0	I give this mac and cheese a 55 on packaging , 55 for maintain organic integrity , 55 on texture , and a 25 for flavor

0	This is pretty good regular style soy sauce
0	But it is not superwonderfulbetter than any other good quality soy sauce you can buy in an Asian market
0	The main value is as a unique giftbr   In the Japanese soy sauce world , there are 4 types regular , mild usukuchi , for raw fish sashimi and light colored
0	Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style
0	Compared to Kikoman a good commercial brand that is widely available Bluegrass starts saltier , is flat in the middle , then ends with a complex   interesting flavor
0	Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round , full flavor in the middle
0	Does n't have the complex ending flavors
0	Each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite
0	On a whim , I ordered a bottle
0	It took several weeks to arrive , but when it did   what a surprise
0	My teenage son wanted to try it , and did
0	He loved it immediately
0	Now he puts it on many things
0	What a treat to find a handmade American product , that competes with and wins , against a JapaneseChinese national staple
0	I had three soy sauces to choose from
0	After some sampling we were all using the Bluegrass
0	Everyone enjoyed the light smoothness a subtle sweetness
0	We were splashing right on every piece , rather that dunkingdipping
0	Friends wanted to know where I found it
0	I recently acquired a bottle of this and was immediately impressed
0	It has good flavor without all the excessive saltiness of supermarket brands
0	I 've used it for marinades and dipping sauces in addition to straight use and in all cases it has added a little something extra
0	Quite a surprise to find an American made soy sauce that tastes this good
0	This soy sauce is the best we have ever had
0	It makes a big difference when using this product
0	Thanks again
0	This is the most delicious soy sauce I have ever tasted
0	I will surely order it again
0	Such deep flavor
0	I am not sure how long the contamination will last
0	I like the idea this product claims no GMO seeds
0	TMI
0	This pack of 6 will last a while , but they 're definitely a ' will reorder '
0	
0	Need a laxative
0	This is a bold blend that has a great taste
0	The flavor comes bursting through
0	Come on Amazon add it to the subscription service
0	This is by far our favorite
0	This coffee is rich but not too stong
0	For now , we 'll buy elsewhere
0	This is one of the best choices , in my opinion
0	These are available at BedBath   Beyond for 10
0	It has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering , and has a pleasant aroma
0	Personally , I would enjoy it more if it were strongerbolder
0	However , being a bit mild , it goes well with breakfast andor glutenfree baked goodies
0	I find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect , nor is a subscription service available
0	Originally found this at Dead Bats from Beyond , used a 20 coupon , and was happy with the final price
0	This coffee is good but , for me , it 's nothing special
0	Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15 Kona
0	And do n't expect it to come in a flash , as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it
0	Really light and creamy
0	This kind of tea not good Taste and smell so wear it 's not like tea , and feel like some thing chemical
0	The Milka Naps Mix Gift Box is a fun , unique gift for those tired of Whitman 's and the usual American brands
0	Nothing wrong with Whitman 's , but sometimes a change of look and flavor is nicebr br As a sampler , it provides only a few of the Milka options
0	Four flavors are here noisette , hazelnuts , alpine milk and strawberry
0	All are delicious , though I do n't like strawberrychocolate in any candy personally , and give those away to eager friends
0	The Naps box are perfect for coffee tables and as a standalone dish at workbr br Milka and its famous purple cow , is owned by Kraft , is an eastern European chocolate originally produced in Switzerland and is available in Germany , Austria , Hungary and other nearby countriesbr br Distribution is still weak in the United States , but can be found increasingly in larger cities
0	Usually , then , it is found only in international grocery stores , though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time
0	It has been around 100 years
0	Whether or not Kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen
0	For now , the texture and taste are better than Hershey 's and Nestle
0	Great candy and our family loved it
0	The shipping to the USA makes it expenive
0	No other item inside our fridge turned bad
0	This product works wonders if you have stomach issues
0	0
0	Bought this at a local specialtyitem store because I adore chutney
0	Because of the higher price and being sold like a gourmet item I wrongly thought it would be better than the affordable brands sold at the supermarket
0	Wrong
0	It is mostly gel jelly with a few fruits sprinkled throughout and tastes like cheap thickened jelly you put on sandwichesI've had much better and that 's just talking about the supermarket brands
0	Very disappointed
0	Money does not buy quality
0	The price was reasonable compared to our local pet store , which does n't often have this item in stock
0	My son made this
0	Determined to be polite , I agreed to have a sandwich using the bread
0	It was amazing
0	Apparently it rises during the baking or somethingbr br Great tangy flavor perfect for a meat sandwich imho and not heavy at all
0	These were great   just as described
0	This is NOT Disco Dust which is edible and made for baking
0	DO NOT purchase this product for such purposes
0	Really easy project for family fun anytime not just for Christmas
0	Just put icing between cookies and stack
0	Then ice outside and decorate
0	Great for all ages
0	Cookies do get a little softer in the middlebr br Make anytime of year
0	Leave off wreat and Patrick and cut out Spongebob 's head so does not look like chirstmas
0	It was a really fun idea that we enjoyed creating
0	The licorice was worthless though
0	this is n't as easy as it looks , does n't came with enough yellow frosting , and the frosting does n't stick very well
0	Which is odd
0	I looked everywhere and could not find ont
0	The gingerbread itself came broken
0	Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken
0	It 's non returnable
0	This one also came broken
0	But two of the same thing in a row
0	I think it 's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped
0	But it 's bubble wrapped very well
0	I think the gingerbread is n't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off
0	The rest of the kit is very cute
0	The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box
0	But the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags
0	Too bad
0	But I would try something else , stay away from this one
0	It probably helps my location is near
0	Everything looks just as described and pictured and I 'm very happy to have done business with this seller
0	The Gingerbread house was carefully packaged as not to harm the fragile pieces inside
0	I 'm excited to give this item as a gift
0	The whole idea of a Spongebob Ginger Bread Pineapple is really great , but the sticker that says Use By Has a 10 JN 16 date on it
0	If that s 2010 this is not good
0	The least the seller could do is to check the expiration date
0	Its right on the front of the box
0	Not happy at all
0	
0	This tea carries the flavor one would expect from the smell terrible
0	My motherinlaw said , Oh , that smells kind of like wine
0	Okay , kind of like wine , with a hint of rot and a moldy aftertaste
0	If it were possible to give this product zero stars , I would have done so
0	After arriving home from the grocery , I immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner
0	Between sorting , washing , and chopping items , the hot water was added to the bag to steep
0	Preparation continued , until a distinctly off odor hit me
0	Even after cleaning up , and airing out the kitchen , my roommate later came in and asked about the smell
0	Save your money to purchase ANY other Twinings product
0	This tea is the best tea i 've ever had
0	i first tasted it in norway , and had to find it in the states
0	It 's a sweet tea , which makes it a wonderful healthy alternative to desert after dinnerbr br I see that others did n't like it , but it 's really a matter of personal tastedifferent courses for different horses
0	The best chocolate in the world , in this critic 's humble opinion , is made in the United States
0	And the best chocolate in the United States is made in California , by the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company
0	It is surely the best chocolate that one can find in so many stores , malls , etc
0	throughout the United States
0	These are chocolates deserving of poetry
0	The choice is up to you
0	This is a good quality brand of chocolate with many flavours of which this is just one
0	Very tasty and a fast delivery too
0	My mother and father were the recipient of these wonderful pieces of chocolate heaven
0	This is the best caramelchocolate combination I have ever tasted
0	The caramel is liquid and complements the Ghiradelli chocolate perfectly
0	The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares , and the Caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste
0	Comparing the two is like comparing Warren Buffett to myself in terms of wealth
0	Unfortunately I am the Caramello bar in this regardbr   At the very least try the Ghiradelli
0	Lesson learned
0	
0	This chocolate treat is a great gift and it arrived right when I expected it to
0	Are people really paying 10 bucks for these chocolates
0	ummmm go to any grocery store and by them for 298 a bagwow
0	Low calorie and satisfying
0	This was really a disappointment
0	While the products included are fine , the real disappointment was the travel mug
0	It is a cheap plastic cup with the nutritional information for the cookies on it
0	So it is basically just a cookie package
0	Yeah , that is really what I want to use as a travel mug
0	I agree with the review that it looks like it came from a dollar store
0	The product description says the polka dot tumbler is definitely a keeper
0	What
0	It is simply cheap packaging
0	Not something of quality to enjoy
0	I like the products inside and the basket is OK , but really this what not what it appeared to be
0	It looks pretty , but the contents are very minute and seem to not be of very high quality
0	There 's a plastic cup for the tea that looks like it came from a dollar store
0	The basket is nice , though
0	Purchased this as a gift for my mother when it was a lightning deal
0	She was very happy and loved the basket
0	She enjoyed the cookies and the flavors of tea that were included
0	Shipped quick and arrived when expected
0	Received very quickly and extremely well packaged
0	Since this is a smaller sized basket , it would be an adorable present for anyone who likes tea , for self or just to have to hand
0	Very nicely assembled with attention to detail
0	Amazon now provides a link
0	They can be used for what are commonly called jello shots , and provide a solid edible alternative to small paper cups
0	I bought these chocolate liquor cups for a party
0	It was a big hit
0	They are high quality and a good buy
0	Great for serving Chocolate liquor
0	Being able to eat the cup afterwards is just icing on the cake
0	Delicious chocolate cups , each in its own aluminum holder
0	After sipping thebr liquor , you can eat the cup
0	What could be nicer
0	Excellent product
0	The holiday liquor cups were exactly what I was looking for
0	The chocolate isbr delicious and holds up well to the liquors
0	strawberry twist has a longlasting pleasant flavor SWEETbut , not excessively so
0	delivery is timely and price is just right
0	Supieror to other TRIDENT flavors
0	Though , SPEARMINT is n't bad either
0	My next pick would be blueberry
0	Trident Strawberry Twist sugarless gum is very disappointing , both in taste and consistency
0	The strawberry flavor is very artificial tasting and , though I guess it is a good thing , not very long lasting
0	The gum also gets stringy fairly quicklybr br I chew a lot of gum , but will not be buying this flavor againbr br Not Recommendedbr br CFH
0	I 'd say , on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 lasting an extraordinary amount of time this would be a 3
0	Also , the taste really diminishes to a subdued sweet after a very short amount of time
0	The gum tasted fresh which is actually way better than when I used to buy it in stores
0	OK it does n't really taste like strawberry , but it 's still delicious
0	BEST DOG FOOD ON THE MARKET TODAY
0	She was also slightly overweight
0	It is specially designed for their teeth and health needs , and she loves it
0	And it is actually cheaper here than at the fancy pet store
0	What more could you ask
0	PetsMart and Petco carried the Cocker Spaniel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio
0	Finding a larger bag has been a great deal
0	My cocker loves the food too
0	It also is packaged very well and as a result stays fresh for a long period of time
0	Great product
0	However all the dogs love it
0	It seems to have cleared up , no more smell
0	All these great changes in a matter of a month
0	Thanks
0	Our skin and fur is much better now too
0	
0	Hard to find elsewhere
0	This is a very high quality oatmeal and much cheaper and better than anything I 've found in the grocery store
0	Better than organic oats advertised elsewhere
0	Takes lots of water
0	These are not minute oats , so my oatmeal cookies come out right , not all crumbly and soggy
0	Instant oats have their place , but not in cookies
0	Honeyville Rolled Oats is a delicious product
0	Their flavor is above all the rest
0	Nice flavor , not too bitter
0	We really like this coffee
0	We have been searching for a coffee that pleases the whole family 's tastes and this is the one
0	I did not like this new taste
0	Cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured
0	New Zealand is uses more cream than Australia , etc
0	The flavor is strong and a bit smoky , like Darjeeling , only earthier
0	Like Darjeeling or Earl Grey , it has enough flavor on its own   no milk or sugar needed
0	But it 's expensive by the box of teabags
0	Finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic
0	It arrived promptly , wellsealed , and true to the label   unlike some loose tea that 's actually cut up , this has the whole leaves that unfurl
0	Ahhh
0	This tea has surpassed all other breakfast teas in this teadrinking household
0	Perhaps it has more caffeine than our old favorites
0	a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductB001ELL9X6Numi Organic Tea Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea , Loose Leaf , 16 oz bag Pack of 2aI brew iced tea in the refrigerator by the halfgallon with this tea
0	Excellent
0	The taste is harsh as it is a lesser grade of Yunnan
0	It is ok to drink , but not to really enjoy
0	This tea is my daily regular tea
0	It 's aromatic and flavorful without any additives
0	It always amazes me that there are not dozens of reviews here extolling the fine qualities of this tea
0	It 's an excellent morning tea , is smooth without being insipid , and is almost impossible to ruin by oversteeping
0	Just use decent water
0	It brings out the natural sweetness of its malty , slightly floral style
0	I just bought another two pounds
0	I hardly ever write reviews but this tea is quite excellent
0	I decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste enhancers
0	It is flavorful without being overpowering
0	It is a great pleasure to have a fine tea like this loose and reasonably priced
0	After the first try I have continued to drink it just as it comes
0	To my mind , a fine caramel should be creamy and melting
0	These are grainy
0	The flavor on these was fine , although a little sweet to my taste
0	Wonderful service from Ms Das , including a hand signed coupon for a discount on future orders , along with samples of a couple other caramel flavors
0	This is certainly the best caramels I have ever had
0	I just wish it came in bigger pieces
0	I finished the whole box in one sitting
0	Not my idea of a good caramel
0	Flavors of ginger and pistachio dominated
0	Same for the chocolate walnut and orange honey varieties
0	This baking soda works great for cooking or for health reasons
0	I take it for acid indigestion and heart burn
0	Just a 1 tsp in a half glass of water and it 's gone
0	Thanks , Bob
0	Too bad that baking SODA does not in any form contain aluminum
0	This is , however a concern for baking POWDER which can , depending on manufacturer , contain aluminum
0	The product is of high quality , and has a rich full flavorbr br Delivery was unexpectedly fastbr br The only negative I would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack
0	While this may be commonplace , a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight , food grade , plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag
0	Could be either a ziplock bag or a twist tie closure does n't make any difference just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of itbr br This is a health and spoilage issue 50 's of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers very expensive and hard to find
0	I am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food security
0	Long term storage is a big issue with people like mebr br Thom Missouri
0	I 'm happy with the quality of the product and the price
0	Like the other reviewer , I would prefer if there was a plastic liner to preserve freshness
0	Product is fresh , good and I 'm not getting complaints anymorebr br That 's worth the large quantity and shipping chargesbr br Hey , its oatmeal
0	My favorite

0	I looooove pocky , got once at lucky 's and could nt stop , its like the chocolate is laced with crack
0	anywho , the product is good , the only sad thing is that it was shipped or stored in a hot room and the chocolate melted together partially , but it did nt take too much effort to take apart the sticksbr br Great product , and great price from this merchant
0	Be sure to keep them refridgerated
0	As far as delivery , the product came in good condition , timely , and was terrific
0	Definitely a good buy
0	  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbingside of the stick is right at the topbr br Each of the packets has 210 calories 90 from fat , and about 80 mg of sodium   so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option
0	Duh
0	
0	The chocolate on the stick was all melted and all the sticks were stuck with oneanother
0	I now love mi goreng
0	Just like the description states , its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate
0	I would n't say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess , well , as long as the chocolate does n't melt
0	Anyways , in case anyone is wondering , I ordered from a seller named Very asia amazoncomgphelpsellerataglancehtmlieUTF8isAmazonFulfilled0orderID10370719445595443marketplaceSeller1sellerA3JW437I54SEI1
0	Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime
0	In my opinion , the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back
0	The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste , more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate
0	The taste is n't terrible but its definitely not to my liking
0	Bought these for my daughter 's Grad party as well as the Strawberry
0	She loves these things
0	They 're a great product
0	Everyone in our family except one really likes the taste of this
0	It is addicting
0	Pocky is just plain fun to eat
0	Very nicebr br This is by no means a health food it 's in the same category as a cookie , it 's got fat and sugar and nonhealthful ingredients
0	But hey , it 's junk food
0	I would n't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes
0	They 're really so good , oh man
0	Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and they 'll likely carry Japanese snacks like these
0	On top of that the package of dessert pocky I ordered in 100 degree weather melted into this liquid goo
0	Well , they did stick together just a bit
0	The chocolate was falling off from the biscuit stick , and does n't taste as it should
0	The Pocky arrived in good condition with minimal melting and very few broken pieces
0	The guys in the family seem to like it better than the ladies for some reason
0	For a bit of insanity , search for Pocky commercials on youtube
0	The individual Pocky sticks are not separately packaged and melt and stick together while being shipped
0	This product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award
0	The box only contains 5 bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal , so at least 50 of the interior of the box is air
0	The rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper
0	On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor
0	The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie
0	They seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process
0	That is why I 've continued to try their products
0	The kids liked them too
0	I love the soft texture and the non crumbly state
0	It makes for clean car rides
0	Since then they like the apple and chocolate bars the best
0	Berry is always left for last
0	Unfortunately , these were pretty gross   miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry
0	I agree with a previous post
0	A total bummer   they were better in the past but something changed with the taste , along with their new packaging
0	
0	My son with multiple food allergies really enjoys these bars
0	They also have a nice chewyness
0	not too sweet but just right
0	any allergy free food is great in my book
0	hope non of these ingredients contains Cornthats a no no for me too
0	IF THE SIZE IT LESS THEN SO SHOULD THE CHARGE
0	THIS WILL EFFECT MY DECISION IN BUYING AGAIN
0	The boxes are now a plain , generic designyou know , the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper
0	Guess what
0	Cheaper ingredients
0	They are oily and bland
0	I thought Enjoy Life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a goodtasting product
0	I was wrong
0	In summary , these are way too expensive to be made with lowquality , unpalatable ingredients
0	Refer to the picture I posted above
0	The bar is half the size you think it is going to beIt is literally a twobite bar
0	Very deceptive advertising
0	That and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star
0	Could n't give it away
0	Everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as I 'm concerned
0	With all the allergies in our family , these ended up working out great
0	I 'm new to food allergies
0	It 's got pretty good texture , taste and heft
0	But each bar is an ounce and 120 calories on par with many other breakfast bars
0	My son has severe allergies
0	Tasty , convenient bars for people with celiac disease
0	They seem to have gotten smaller over time , but the taste and convenience outweigh the reduction in size and the price
0	My favorite flavor is the apple and nut
0	This brand of granola bars are really good
0	The very berry are my favorite
0	However , the bars are almost ridiculously small
0	They really are tiny
0	So , the taste is GREAT but the bar is small
0	Hard to find when roaming around
0	Great taste
0	Great ingredients
0	Great texture
0	Absolutely delicious
0	These snack bars fit the bill
0	They have the mouthfeel of a traditional snack bar , and a pleasant tartsweet fruit flavor
0	I buy these regularly
0	Imagine taking some kids ' playground chalk , perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks
0	Being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth
0	TRY IT
0	
0	This is the best coffee we 've ever had
0	A light taste but very full bodied
0	I was very pleased with the packaging , having it resealable keeps it stay fresher much longer and unlike other brands this construction stays intact
0	This is the best coffee we 've ever had
0	Hundreds of people come to The Pavilion every day looking for American coffee and they were not disappointed
0	Buy it

0	For those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white Jasmine tea , Numi 's Flower Jewel is worth a look
0	About the size of a gumball , these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower
0	They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this teabr br Decorative does not mean tasteless
0	As a white tea , the flavor is mild , but rich and soothing
0	The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea
0	I have had stronger jasmine teas , but this one is quite balanced and tasty
0	I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade
0	The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and do n't get bitter if seeped for long periodsbr br I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels
0	Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart , though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact
0	Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf
0	The first ball worked pretty well , it just looked a little beaten up
0	Since then , half of these have fallen to pieces in hot water all of them do after sitting for a bit
0	If you do n't mind the rate of failure , the tea itself is pretty good and fairly tolerant of being steeped for a long time especially considering that it is white tea
0	Numi has a winner here with this tea
0	It is very pleasant and the reason they love it , it does not turn bitter after longer steeping , like other teas do
0	The product is all that it says it is which is why I gave it 5 stars
0	It smells like an Indian spice and while it did n't work for me , scentwise , it may work fine with someone else
0	Both our twins love this one right from the start but it 's not loaded with lentils see ingredients below
0	Along with some others , we get this one with the subscription
0	Of course , with twins one is forced to buy more in bulk and we 're so busy that it 's great to get these deliveredbr br The packaging is excellent
0	After water , sweet potatoes are the first ingredient in this one , followed by apricot puree
0	That 's dessert for them right there
0	After that comes the chicken and then brown rice flour not as good as brown rice thoughbr br This is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly
0	Almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters
0	Add apricot puree and there 's really not much one could do to discourage babies after that
0	This list of ingredients looks excellent and it 's a green color naturallybr br The babies liked it
0	Earth 's Best Turkey Vegetable Dinner hits the spot with apples with turkey
0	Babies love carrots since they 're sweet to their taste , so that made a great addition
0	My little girl ca n't get enough of this
0	I like that it is organic and contains fruit , veggies , protein and grains in one tasty meal
0	Its my daughter 's favorite first and foremost
0	Wow , i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars
0	My daughter does n't like a lot of baby foods , but will eat this one
0	It 's also a bit bland , so I add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up
0	As an added bonus , it works wonders for her digestive tract
0	I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken
0	I wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein
0	This is my son 's favorite dinner
0	Best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein 21 , vitamin A 100 and C 30
0	It is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it
0	Love love love this brand and flavor
0	Would be a quality product if it were n't so thin
0	Nearly the consistency of soup
0	It just makes too much of a mess no matter how careful you try to be
0	Its not the case
0	Enter this product
0	The truth is , is that yes , it has a bit of fruit in it , but its not sweet at all
0	The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you do n't have to add anything else
0	Its a great product to enter proteins into baby 's diet
0	The consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal to it also , baby will not choke on it
0	I highly recommend
0	I 've tried it myself and think it is pretty gross
0	But my daughter still eats it , just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors
0	It 's got a decent amount of protein , which is important for us as a vegetarian family
0	My triplets will not eat this , eventhe one who will eat ANYTHING
0	The consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon
0	My baby LOVES sweet potatoes
0	Ick
0	The flavor is just right , not too sweet or too savory , and does n't have a strong chicken flavor
0	Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp , thus it 's a very good first protein to offer , and good for picky eaters
0	However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gaggingtexture problems
0	This is the only food my daughter will eat consistly
0	She really enjoys it
0	The packaging is great
0	Never had any broken having ordered 4 times
0	My son loves the rice and lentil jars
0	It 's not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars
0	I have it on order with subscribe and save   amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged
0	It was one of their favorite baby foods
0	Great price
0	I was appalled
0	Do n't buy Earth 's Best
0	Really disappointing
0	He eats the entire jar for dinner and always wants more
0	The product shipped very quickly
0	She loved it at first
0	I 've tried some of it as well
0	I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon
0	I like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein
0	I love the fact that there is turkey being offered
0	This is my son 's 2nd favorite dish
0	No issues with it and a good balance of nutrients
0	Only three jars came in a form edible to babies
0	The rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water
0	It also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixturebr Pretty disappointing and a waste of money
0	This is one of my son 's favorite baby foods
0	It does have a bit of sweetness , but not too sweet
0	It 's more runny than some of the other flavors , so we use a deeper spoon with this one , or add a little rice cereal to thicken it up
0	For whatever reason , our son really likes this flavor
0	Some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar
0	That 's a fair price   not an amazing deal , but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store
0	It 's a good one
0	My daughter LOVES it
0	He was so picky
0	Their foods taste greateven for us adult and so good for you too
0	Little Baby Picky will only eat this sometimes
0	This one is more watery than the others , so keep that in mind
0	There is absolutely nothing bad to say about these
0	Great on the go snack
0	My daughter loved this stuff
0	It is all natural and made very well
0	Good to mix with other things as they get older too
0	Beats Gerber
0	My daughter is outgrowing baby food but will still eat this
0	To be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible
0	Up all night screaming from gas pains
0	Garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies
0	She refused to eat it
0	I would n't recommend this flavor
0	The consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat   not too thick , not too thin
0	This is my daughter 's most favorite baby food by far
0	This is the only ones she 'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds
0	However , the taste is very bland , for me as an adult at least
0	PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD
0	They like all the flavors though
0	Great textures too
0	I just learned this and am telling everyone   only glass recycles forever
0	It 's not even a hard thing to do anymore
0	Stop being lazy
0	Plastic
0	in food
0	baby food
0	Pretty good product
0	The taste is n't the best but it 's definitely not the worse either
0	It gives a pretty smooth energetic kick
0	He said the fruit was very fresh and sweet
0	Happy with this healthy purchase
0	This fruit gift really was the perfect gift
0	Everything was fresh , well packed and tasty looking
0	And the people that received it assured me that it was quite tasty tasting too
0	And tried the chocolate covered cherries ad was surprised at how delicious they were
0	So thank you
0	Dharana , San Francisco
0	The Fruit actually tasted fresh and yummy
0	I have never seen it in a tea bag before
0	The bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that I will buy again and again
0	Plus the shipping time was great
0	I would dig tender roots or bark a few trees for a delightful tea
0	I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product
0	Not a good bargain
0	I switched to Pappy 's extract
0	The tea is excellent and the price was right for me
0	She absolutely loves it , made a great surprise christmas gift
0	I 'm actually gon na order the 4pack and continue drinking it over time
0	Do n't trust the FDA
0	
0	bought this for my dad
0	I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it
0	So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form
0	I was told is was Pappy 's Sassafras Concentrate
0	I was very dissapointed
0	It did n't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting
0	It was more like black licorice , which I hate , with a very mild rootbeer undertone
0	Bottom line I wo n't buy the teabags again
0	Great tasting tea I have been looking for a good Sassafras tea foreverFinally
0	I will be ordering this product again br Thanks KimD
0	It did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful
0	Yucky , yucky stuff
0	These are good sunflower seeds at a good price if you prefer the unsalted variety , which can be hard to findbr br One thing to keep in mind though , is the expiration or best by date
0	And it 's very hot , did n't have to add any spices at all
0	Great product , will purchase again
0	Now as far as the item itself , this brand of Panang Paste is excellent
0	The beef panang dish my friend made using this paste was as good as the ones in the Thai restaurant
0	I would recommend the paste but not the price
0	Best paste I have tried
0	So easy to use
0	Just saute you meat , add veggies , paste , and a tin of coconut milk
0	Quick and tasty
0	I am on weight watchers and tried using the light coconut milk instead of the full fat
0	It works for the panang paste especially if you add a heaping tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter but the yellow , green , and red are spicy and need the full fat coconut milk to balance it out
0	OMG I would love these cookies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal
0	DEGUSTING is n't even a strong enough word
0	HORRIBLE , HORRIBLE , DISGUTINGLY , MEDICINAL TASTE
0	DO NOT BUY
0	This gravy mix is excellent   except , do n't use water where called for , use milk instead , and it makes it 100 better
0	
0	BY FAR
0	BISQUICK CHEESE GARLIC BISQUITS Like Red Lobster 's , served with a small side of watercress scrambled eggs
0	It 's super easy to make and THICK
0	FINGER LICKIN
0	MMMmmmm
0	PIONEER BRAND as the name says is A HOMESTYLE , AMERICAN CLASSIC
0	Nothing easier
0	Nothing better
0	Even beats grandmother 's white gravy recipe
0	Already peppered for you
0	You do nothing but mix it with water
0	Takes only a minute or two
0	I highly recommend this gravy mix
0	It will not disappoint
0	It is VERY easy to make and tastes great , also
0	Goes very well over mashed potatoes , meats , etc
0	Try it
0	I do n't think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable
0	So you do n't have to do the math7   38   184 per single
0	Online price 27   114   236 shipping not calculated in
0	Looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier , you can get a case of 12 boxes for 69 , no sales tax and free shippingsounds like a great deal
0	12 x 19   228 singles so 69   228   302 per single   the most expensive at all
0	At work , we have a water cooler with hot water dispenser
0	This brewed in hot water just like a tea bag making tea tastes far better than any instant coffee
0	Best way to make iced coffee
0	I live in the dorms without a kitchen so making a cup of coffee was really easy with this
0	Its just like making tea and tastes decent enough
0	Not starbucks but good enough with some sugar and cream
0	I do n't particularly like instant coffee
0	vending machinesbr br Jerry
0	In this economy , no one wants to pay those high prices , so we started a coffee club
0	20 of us buy these coffee bags and separate creamer and enjoy fresh , hot , tasty coffee every day without paying the coffee shop prices
0	thanks Folgers
0	
0	This is the best tasting coffee
0	It 's easy to make without a mess
0	Fast , easy and definitely delicious
0	Makes a great cup of coffee and very easy to make
0	Good purchase
0	Will continue to order from herebr Thanx
0	It has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma
0	It has a nice reddish color
0	The flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity
0	The color is that of muddy water , and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well
0	Well worth every penny
0	I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price
0	Both the quality and price are better than others that I have purchased for the same quantity
0	This is a great product for those looking for an MSG and Gluten free product , and is also lower sodium than any other marinade or soy sauce out there
0	I looked at the ingredients and was quite pleasedbr with the natural ingredients and no calories
0	This hot sauce is one of my favorites
0	Its a perfect balance of tasty and spicy
0	A mix of garlic , habanero , and other spices
0	I highly recommend this to anyone who likes hot sauce
0	The DJ
0	's were sampling the sauce and raving about it , So I picked up a bottle at the local grocery , It 's so good
0	I keep a bottle in the kitchen and an extra bottle on hand for gifts and for taking to potlucks , barbecues and party 's
0	This is my favorite hot sauce
0	I liketo use it to give anything some extra flavor
0	It 's hot , but not without flavor
0	I do n't like those sauces that just burn but have no taste
0	This has both burn and and awesome flavor
0	I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good hot sauce
0	I also love the pineapple
0	You will not go wrong ordering this up
0	This is my favorite hot sauce
0	Hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy
0	My favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far
0	Thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce
0	It goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kickbr br The sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears
0	It is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use
0	We love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice
0	absolutely love the habenaro sauceuse it on eggs , sandwiches most anything for a good kick
0	have watched the progessing popularity of theis homegrown producthave nothing but the highes accolades for the chef and the productget out there and try it
0	I in fact love the medium sauce the taste is so yummy with a bit of zing behind it
0	Kind of like a HIS   HERS package
0	Keep up the hard work
0	Man what can i say , this salsa is the bomb
0	i have all the different kinds
0	i have it with almost every meal
0	do nt sleep on this hot sauce
0	
0	this sauce is so good with just about anything , i like adding it to asian food or anything with egg or noodles , it has a good burn with a strong flavor
0	i m hoping to see some of the other flavors like the pineapple experiment on here soon
0	buy it you wo nt regret it
0	Not hot at all
0	Like the other low star reviewer , I got suckered by seeing ' habenero ' in the name and the 12 oz size
0	Some people might like the flavor , citrusy and it has some fish sauce in the mix according to the ingredient label , but if you 're looking for hot this ai n't it
0	I ve been reading different websites , and have come to a shocking conclusion
0	I am THAT guy
0	The one who is insainly insecure , and has fears of losing the love in his life
0	The one who ddenyed help and acted like it was everyone elses fault for making me mad
0	The one who destroyed a great relationship
0	The one that had love , and twisted it , tortured it so that now it does nt exist
0	The one who could nt control his own outbursts , but tried to control everyone else
0	The one who once had the dream , but forced it away
0	I am the one
0	I m not happy about it
0	I m not bragging about it
0	I did this , noone else
0	To all those who are in abusive relationshipsdemand your spouse get help
0	If they wontleave
0	That s what my wife did
0	What s done is done

0	Judge Olsen not the real name would never take a child away from hisher mother
0	Canadian exhusbands and fathers also poured out their wrath
0	Incendiary comments are going to get reported
0	And I have clearly acknowledged in past columns that spousal violence is perpetrated by both men and women
0	But there is no denying that women are much more likely than men to be the victims of the most severe physical abuse and spousal homicide
0	Still , the men want their say so let 's proceed
0	Men wrote about being assaulted by their wives   with no subsequent charges by the police
0	Former Edmonton lawyer Grant Brown has heard it all
0	The thesis of my book is that judges actually create the deadbeats
0	A lot of dads just give up
0	Police , prosecutors and judges are generally harsher with men in domestic abuse cases , says Brown
0	And , he adds , judges rarely punish women who violate court orders
0	Dads can spend thousands and thousands of dollars trying to see their kids and the judges do nothing to make it happen , says Brown
0	To some extent , judges are faced with an impossible task , he acknowledges , because the court system is adversarial
0	Everything hinges on proving that the other parent is a badass of some kind
0	He 'd like to see mandatory mediation in bitter divorce cases as well as a legal presumption of shared parenting
0	The money should be going to the kids instead of paying for the lawyers , says Brown
0	Now that 's a story
0	Been married for 7 years , together for 10
0	Just some background info
0	She has a teenager that has issues and is a hand full to say the least
0	We did things together and had a lot of fun , love and laughter
0	Again it has been 3 months
0	How long should I wait
0	It does n't seem to matter what we say or do
0	I should also mention that the step sister baby almost died because the mother took drugs during the pregnancy and the childrens aid society is quite involved in the care of the infant
0	Is some sort of boot camp the answer
0	Hi
0	I am mainly just on here for support right now
0	I was having quite a bit of spotting   some bleeding but not much
0	I do n't feel like doing much of anything lately
0	Also I 'll get a little lightheaded
0	Well i m 23weeks preg
0	Okay
0	It was still liquidy but contained a few clumps
0	Is there even anything to worry about
0	Does this sound like pregnancy
0	I really hope someone can help
0	Thank you all so much
0	I 'm so stressed out
0	well it went away and came back a couple of days ago
0	Painful to press in the general area , but I ca nt find the lump
0	It seems everything is shutting down on me
0	I have just been treated for a chronic sinus infection
0	Wondering if the lump that only appears when coughing is of concern
0	I just ca n't control it
0	Sorry for this being so long , everything has to be said to understand it
0	Nothing ever happened it was swept under the carpet never talked about
0	No apologies from my parents no hugs of comfort
0	Am I missing something
0	Is there something about me that attracts these stupid assholes
0	I 'm a wonderful person so why are these people always showing up
0	Idk
0	So this is the whole story
0	The only thing in my life that helps with this feeling is running track
0	Now I am not sure
0	And maybe why I am feeling this way
0	Please help
0	Maybe she just forgot
0	I feel very emotional and cry myself to sleep most of the time for no reason
0	I 'm angry all the time and do n't feel like laughing
0	my sleeping pattern and eating habits is messed up
0	
0	I am at lost
0	He underwent a joint operation and was prescribed hydrocodone for the pain
0	My husband does not drink or do drugs but was taking statin medication at the time
0	Which mean missing work for a week was not ideal
0	Still he had the surgery done and upon returning to work , suffered was is called a dissociation
0	I am taking about an intelligent man , that would of never done this
0	In fact , this realization has induced a depression
0	Please note that no intercourse happen since he could not perform
0	After the operation , he remembers the oral sex with this person
0	Not for this person who he was nt attracted too , physically , emotionally or spiritually
0	He is in shock himself
0	In sum , can a burnout andor hydrocode , provoke dissociation
0	If it had been the reverse , the woman could of charge a man for attempting to take advantage of one who was on medication and was aware of the extreme job pressure she was actually enjoying being secretive
0	Please help us
0	When I put a tampon in , when it comes out it 's clean except for one spot on the side has a fair bit of blood on it
0	I 'd say it 's at the upper third or very top of the vaginal canal
0	I have also been experiencing a bit of constipation , but not serious
0	Just slightly strenuous bowel movements , though nothing extremely bothersome
0	Or could it be cervical cancer
0	I am so , so , so scared

0	But first you need to go here to get a pregnancy test
0	That started to freak me out
0	They took urine and a blood test and it came out positive
0	I was so shocked
0	She was shocked , and looked frightened honestly
0	There was no way
0	I was tiny and had n't gotten any bigger
0	Not even a baby bump
0	It seemed completely impossible
0	And was told she weighed 42 pounds
0	I have a noticeable belly now

0	I 've been undergoing a very traumaticstressful situation for approximately 4years now , while living in another city
0	I live in a constant state of stress in the other city
0	My thyroid hormones were normal , normal blood sugar
0	Urine tests came back normal
0	Can anyone shed some light on that condition , or maybe an interpretation of what is happening to me physiologically
0	I get short of breath now it 's hard to just keep the chores up around the house
0	Thanks
0	Ok I have a serious question
0	Anyway
0	Also I was always a light flow and sometimes now it looks like a miscarriage
0	Also I was never the PMSy type
0	So is all this normal menopause behavior
0	Also any tips would be appreciated
0	Mostly this sadness was off and on until recently
0	A few months ago the sadness has just really taken ahold
0	I feel very different from other people
0	I 've come to have a complete hatred for myself
0	I am so scared of being alone forever
0	But the thought of one day killing myself is becoming more realistic every day
0	I would really like to know if anyone understand this or feels this way
0	I feel somewhat crazy , detached , unsure , and constantly filled with anxiety
0	I do n't know how or why this started
0	From ages 4 till 8 I was a confident , normal seeming child
0	When I first started secondary school things got worse
0	I made a new friend
0	I ended up moving out of town and moving schools due to the bullying
0	People in this school did tease me a little , but that 's just school life right
0	But it seemed I could n't handle it
0	Ever since that happened I 'd be sad , a lot
0	I would burst out in to tears and become extremely violent
0	I start screaming , swearing , punching walls , throwing stuff around
0	It 's like something else takes over
0	The sound of people speaking in the class would make me angry and upset
0	I 'd get suspended for getting so mad at everyone
0	This was the only thing that took my mind off things
0	I cry thinking of having to face people outside , having to socialise
0	The feeling is horrible
0	The anger is the part that scares me a lot
0	The slightest thing will make me kick off
0	I 've been extremely happy
0	I like being antisocial Is that normal
0	It upset me deeply
0	Any advice will be taken

0	I did n’t turn out right
0	But I do n’t have low self esteem and a lack of confidence
0	Nothing
0	What do I do …
0	The medicine was working well and the pressure in my head was gone
0	But sometimes , I would feel lightheadedness but it 's fine
0	However , I went to another EENT to have a second opinion
0	He also said that it might be due to stress and consequently affecting the brain
0	Is there any illness whose symptom is like that
0	Pap is good
0	I have been put on antibiotics
0	My brother has recently had a melanoma
0	I had to insist to have it off

0	Hello dear forum members
0	As an auditor I 've been revising oil refinery laboratory and petcoke production workshop for a short period of time
0	More precisely , I was controlling different benzene analyses in the lab , there was a problem with ventilation and was a very strong smell of benzene around
0	1
0	If there 's something wrong going on in my brain or what
0	Well , I think only a fool would believe that right
0	What an unusual thing
0	Is that a coincidence
0	2
0	Tell me is that a coincidence too
0	3
0	How can you explain these too
0	4
0	Or my mind can really get into others head
0	Or I was just hallucinating about all these things
0	Thanks a lot
0	Nice , funny , beautiful , caring
0	The wierdest part is that this whole thing really does nt seem to bother her too much
0	I ca n't understand it
0	I am just really confused
0	I really need some help understanding this
0	thanks a ton
0	My psychiatrist prescribed 50 mg of seroquel , and 2200 mg tablets of tegretol
0	Kind Regards , Jack
0	I will briefly describe all three symptoms in more detail 1
0	The bed sheets are also completely wet from sweating
0	2
0	The confusion manifests itself as a sense of anxiety , combined with a rapid movement of thought and an inability to identify a rational cause to it
0	Do n't ask too heavy for what , as there is no answer , it 's entirely irrational
0	3
0	The tachycardia is typically around 130bpm when I first measure it , immediately upon getting out of bed , but quickly falls to around 110
0	The fluctuations are quite large , for example it would fall to 90 in 1520 seconds , and then in another 20 seconds it would increase to 110 , and then repeats
0	It 's associated with breathing   especially when I breathe in , the heart seems to start beating much faster
0	This is associated with an oxygen saturation of 9698 measured through pulse oximetry , with an average of 97 most probably
0	In terms of blood pressure , it is between 1358015595
0	I 've done a series of ECGs in the past , all normal the ECGs were n't done when these events happened though
0	After the symptoms calm down roughly 40mins , then I can go back to sleep
0	I go back to sleep , but find it troubling to fall asleep now
0	Most of the time , after falling asleep again , I would wake up after another 1hr or so , with similar symptoms outlined in 13 but of much lower intensity at least one more time
0	After some time , I can fall asleep , but it 's never a deep sleep , and it 's relatively light
0	Is this due to stress from not sleeping
0	Thanks
0	PS These allnighters are associated with moderate consumption of alcohol OR caffeine never both though
0	The baby is 2 months now
0	However , the baby is here now
0	But it is too late for that
0	I made 3 appointments to the abortion clinic and could not bring myself to abort the baby
0	Researching all I can
0	Sometimes I just feel blank or have to have a drink to get started or feel enthusiasm
0	Does anyone else have this kind of problem
0	and have they found a cureExhausted
0	Hugs and Thanks K
0	I am a 31 yr old female who is currently diagnosed as bipolar
0	I live a normal life
0	I am starting to get worried about myself
0	I NEVER act out on these thoughts , but it is an every day occurance
0	I just do nt know what to do anymore
0	Any thoughts , suggestions , or info would be much appreciated
0	This is difficult
0	I never told anyone this
0	I grew into a horribly angry and aggressive teenager
0	Any thoughts welcome
0	I 'm so frustrated with just about everything
0	When I finally had the money to buy another one , it was like unicorns , rainbows , and lollipops
0	But I always seem to get the faulty products
0	I 'm so sick of having to return or exchange things
0	I have better things to be dealing with
0	This side of the family refuses to talk about anything
0	There are family issues , financial issues , work issues , school issues , personal issues , relationshipfriend issues , ugh   it just goes on and on
0	I ca n't handle it
0	And it 's seriously one thing after another
0	Bizarre , eh
0	Anyway
0	I 've been waiting to get an amplifier to use it , because despite what it says about having a built in amplifier , it does n't
0	But it worked   it turned on and spun around to play vinyl
0	I have about a five second memory span
0	I can not take care of myself
0	I 'm only 23   life should n't be this difficult
0	And it 's not just vision
0	Honestly , I 'm just letting it go
0	It 's too stressful , too time consuming , and too expensive to dive into when I already know the answer
0	Family situation
0	Ugh
0	The biggest pain in my butt
0	Thinking about it is giving me a headache
0	This pain feels quite colicky when it occurs and can last from a few minutes or up to an hour
0	The pain can be very intense and on the pain score i would rate it as an 8 out of 10
0	I also experience a lot of palpitations on rest
0	I feel so embarrassed
0	Sorry for the runon sentence
0	She said some HRT OTC stuff has soy as a component and there could be interaction there
0	Something about Soy mimicking estrogen
0	I have no idea
0	Anyway , has anyone else tried Remifemin
0	it might be too much at once
0	This has a lower dose than taking the later straight
0	Also I read coconut oil helps
0	Anyone have any other suggestions
0	Thanks
0	Approx
0	Onoff sharp pain when pressing on navel , constant nausea every day , foul smelling vaginal discharge , onoff lower back pain , usually dull but sometimes sharper
0	All of this worsens with physical activity and during menstruation
0	Some days will be worse in general
0	I get bloated a lot of the time
0	It 's not huge , maybe 12 cm in diameter , and it 's a bit rubbery and seems to be slightly mobile
0	It 's tender to the touch
0	Not tingly like pins and needles , more like some sort of mild sensation through them
0	Does this sound like it is cancer
0	
0	Recently I 've noticed there had been a growing distance between us , nothing mean , just not as close
0	So enter the incident
0	Our garage door had broken and was in danger of falling
0	This was very stressful , as I was thinking about it falling on us , the car etc
0	Sure we nagged at each other about little crap from time to time , but never a screaming angry fight
0	That 1 word as loud as I could
0	But in this 1 moment , with this 1 word , I shattered that
0	She 's timid about it though
0	So I guess that 's progress
0	Danger is what she felt though
0	This message might seem all over the place cause I do n't know where to start
0	I just turned 24
0	I 'm married and have a step son
0	Got a new job making a lot less money only income in the house , husband ca n't find a job
0	Got so far behind on bills and received shut off notices
0	I 'm still trying to catch up financially even though it feels impossible
0	I 've been feeling depressed everyday
0	I cry almost everyday
0	It seems like everyday of my life is a repeat so it feels useless living this life
0	We argue almost everyday over stupid things
0	Does anyone have any advice
0	Ok
0	I 'm done
0	Enough is ENOUGH
0	And he showed it
0	I 'm an architect
0	Went out with girlfriend after divorce
0	Well , that was the night I met POS husband 2
0	The bass player from the band
0	Sometimes
0	I can make REALLY bad decisions
0	To keep it short
0	TOTAL POS
0	But that 's not the worst of it
0	I 've landed a great job with an awesome firm
0	That was going good
0	Still is POS was out of house
0	Finally had peace
0	I got a PUPPY
0	A beautiful Irish setter named Bella
0	She 's awesome
0	Going good
0	Finally
0	Starting to relaxdecompress Now
0	Very good chance I have an INCREDIABLY rare form of a blood cancer
0	Yeah
0	Still ca n't quite get used to hearing the words eosinophilia , hypereosinophilic disorder , preLEUKEMIA
0	And this thing is the rarest of all the blood cancers
0	Wish I never knew that word
0	   Really
0	And only reason I went to doc was for an ear infection
0	All tests thus far to determine why elevated eos have come back negative
0	Except my blood work
0	It 's changing
0	High eos still
0	Next labs , low iron saturation
0	Iron level fine
0	Processing iron , no
0	Labs after that
0	Anemia
0	So I 'm on iron , pretty strong
0	BUT
0	Yet another abnormality shows up
0	This time it 's what 's called the red blood cell differential
0	It measures the diameter of your blood size
0	Healthy RBC are consistent in size
0	Unhealthy ones are not
0	Looks like I 'll be getting a bone marrow biopsy pretty soon
0	It 's all too muchwaaaaaayy too much
0	This female is herself in an open marriage with 2 kids
0	I said no way
0	So I 'm really confused
0	I had breast cancer w chemo , xrt ,   now tamoxifen
0	The toamoxifen limits the antidepressants I can take
0	He tried viibryd   fetzima same response
0	I took serzone as a teen which worked well
0	Took it about a year , weaned off , never had depression again til now
0	Does it act similarly to remeron
0	Is it THAT dangerous
0	My depression is dangerous as well as weight gain has been shown to increase breast cancer recurrence
0	Also , I 'd like to not have to starve myself
0	Thanks for any info
0	Today marks the 5th of July
0	It was very light and dark brown
0	Could this be dark brown since it is old blood that should 've came last week
0	There 's been veins visible all around the skin reaching to the nipple
0	My nipples have gotten darker and larger
0	No , they have not been aching or sensitive
0	My sense of smell has stayed normal
0	I 've also had cramps and headaches
0	Could these be signs of puberty
0	Could these be PMS symptoms
0	Could these be in relation to my hormones
0	This overuse of medication has now led to 2 ER visits due to falling down the stairs and in the shower several times resulting in severe head blows
0	The stools have a very foul odor
0	Labs performed at the ER visits also confirmed the long term medication use has resulted in elevated liver enzyme levels , yet of course is still being prescribed these medications
0	Do her symptoms indicate a possibility of colon cancer recurrence
0	Any suggestions would be so appreciated
0	My MRI was fine , thank goodness
0	A little pain in my chest
0	Heart attack
0	A pain in my leg
0	Blood clot
0	Left shoulder hurts
0	Heart attack
0	Plus the heart palpitations
0	Ugh
0	On and on
0	Is this going to help with depression
0	Any advice would be appreciated
0	Thanks for any opinions
0	It has gotten worse with time and events that have happened in my life
0	One is that I can NOT drive anywhere without having some sort of panic attack or very stressful episode
0	Another is my mood swings
0	I use to be so confident , did beauty pageants , was a cheerleader , on student council , active with friends and family
0	Am I just having mood swings
0	Am I bipolar
0	Please help
0	This is the second marriage for both of us
0	We went to marriage counseling and this has gotten better
0	I am not in a financial position to leave
0	I need some advice
0	It worked
0	It 's easier to get help for an alcoholic the a BP
0	It is almost impossible to turn my head completely to one side or the other
0	I have sooooo many other problems going on as well
0	IBS , Irratable bladder , chronic fatigue , Fibro , Breast lump problems , Heart problems , diverticulosis of both the bowel and bladder , massive sikin cancer , footfeet problems , joint and muscle pain , massive muscle spasams
0	I could go on and on
0	One Dr did do a blood test which showed high levels in my liver
0	But then nothing was done
0	I live in the statesFl
0	does anyone know of a facility that might be interested in finding out what these are
0	The buck stops here
0	For various things mainly for spitting , hitting , teachers and students
0	She does nt listen for nothing
0	She acts like it is a game
0	I m am so tired of dealing with these behaviors
0	her primary doctor has nt prescribed any thing for meds
0	We will be soon enough however the teachers feal its more than just adhd
0	however it seems her behaviors have worsened because of the other students being just as bad or worse
0	And though the last stretch sounds dull , feels like it will never end and is very hard moment by moment , joy can be found in their passing
0	There are gifts given to us over time through much pain and effort , like affection from a lover , trust from a friend , money from an employer
0	But other gifts are given freely and instantly without any effort , but they are just as or perhaps more valuable and meaningful
0	It was like I did n’t exist
0	I did n’t even have the impact of a ghastly ghost , ‘ cause at least ghosts and goblins cause a person to react
0	Right after dusk , dew settled onto the grass
0	It was like the grass was blanketed with diamonds just for me
0	But not lonely …
0	This is going to be a bit long just a fair warning
0	She was always a stay at home mom
0	This went on for another 5 months
0	He did n't seem very happy tho
0	I was in complete shock
0	It 's been difficult writing this
0	I often find myself looking for mother figures which sounds really weird
0	It 's really weird
0	Is it normal for me to feel depressed
0	I have n't been with another girl since
0	I do n't know take this
0	Is this just the over the top emotions of BPD
0	Hi
0	I go to regular therapy , attend a very rigirous school , and live with a very strict family
0	Recently , my family life has been kind of rough
0	However , it still makes me feel rejected
0	This amounts to 1,000 or more
0	I 'm jobless and have never had any way to make money
0	I honestly do n't know what to do anymore
0	I do n't know how to stop feeling so overwhelmed
0	Please help
0	Thank you for taking the time to read this
0	Advice would be appreciated
0	My experience on that medication was horrifying
0	It was as if the only emotions I exhibited were either spiraling depression , angerfrustration , or absolutely nothing at all
0	I believe myself to have severemanic depression , severe anxiety , and quite possibly a touch of bipolar disorder
0	Any suggestions on what I should do to start getting things finally taken care of
0	Thanks
0	She had 6 or 7 suicidal attempts
0	Things are so hurtful you can not even imagine
0	Sexual perversion sadism and controlling is just a part of what might have started as an emotional affair
0	Help
0	I need some advise
0	He also seems very aroused by the idea of rough sex , or ' rape '
0	Am I just being silly and over thinking things due to that email
0	Or is this the start of what broke down his previous relationships
0	Any help would be greatly appreciated
0	Thank you
0	I really do n't know what 's going on
0	Why
0	Because I had questions about schizophrenia
0	Eh , let 's start from the beginning
0	This started just a couple months ago 1I've been hearing weird thingsDripping Like something thick was dripping on the carpet , a train , footsteps and breathing
0	2I think that everyone is after me
0	3I could n't see the train , but I could hear it
0	It was coming right at me
0	The train conductor wants me dead
0	4I'm scared someone is going to pop out from the doorway and get me
0	Or someone will come and rob meTake all of our money
0	7I think there is microscopic video cameras everywhere , recording my every move
0	8Everything has to be neat and tidynothing at all out of place
0	10I feel like someone is peeking through the windows
0	Like , someone dressed in all black with huge black eyes
0	11For a couple days , or even a week , I'm super happy
0	Then a couple days , or a week later , I'm really sad
0	12I've been faking who I am on here and on other websites
0	Not a real person , fictional , so it 's not illegal
0	13I'm always wide awake , and it takes me awhile to fall asleep
0	14I'm really nervous and scared right now , but I feel like laughing and smiling
0	No one had any answers
0	I 've already been diagnosed with anxiety and depression
0	My dad may be bipolar
0	I do n't know
0	He hates doctors
0	My mom has depression , also
0	I 'm so scared right now , and so nervous
0	I broke a fan earlier because it was moving weird
0	I could go on and onBut let 's get to the point
0	What is wrong with me
0	Please , help me
0	Help , please
0	I know it sounds silly to address this question
0	Maybe I need courage to carry it out , or acceptance It is irreversible
0	Never coming out to greet me even once
0	Even then I sit silently on a couch in the hall and silently cry while listening to music
0	This is very infrequent
0	Ok those bouts were in the past year once in six months or so
0	so he did
0	That s when our ugly fight started the name calling started
0	This all makes me suicidal
0	I just can not keep at hoping always
0	Those are my silent wishes
0	Life seemed pretty good
0	The amount of stress that follows this job is not something I can keep doing much longer
0	But not having a job I can tolerate and being single is n't helping
0	I keep applying for jobsI go out quite a bitI try dating
0	But somehow my life seems to be at a standstill
0	I keep thinking is this all there is to life
0	Is it too late to start over and do something else
0	I have a 13 yr old daughter honors student who has never given us a moments trouble
0	We had many medical exams   test run that came up nonconclusive
0	Shortly thereafter out of the blue she eluded to thoughts of harming herself to the school counselors which landed us in heart wrenching treatment at a facility
0	She keeps relapsing however
0	There was seemingly an attempt
0	A mild one   probably a cry for attention more than anything else but anything in that realm in to be taken seriously and is SO scary for a parent
0	She is such a good girl , smart , etc
0	Even with the missed school etc
0	she has maintained honor roll in advanced content classes
0	She is extremely hard on herself
0	She comes from a stablesupportive Christian homeno history of any kind of abuse , etc
0	There is no significant family hx
0	It seems the hormone change with cycles also seems to significantly lower the Seratonin level
0	I would love to know if anyone knows if this is medically possible or has had similiar situation
0	If so , what has helped you
0	I am drained at the vague doctors , etc
0	toying around with meds vague results with side affects that seem to be such a trade off
0	It feels like a   shoot with my daughter
0	I hear   read of bad ramifications of a young woman being on birth control for long periods of time
0	She is a 13 yr old never been kissed girl
0	Of course she only needs it for med
0	reasons but I want to know this is safe to take with those other meds etc
0	Does anyone know
0	Of course the Drs say yes but they have even been vague with diagnosis
0	They 've told us the dx
0	What 's a mother to do or thinkPlease help
0	Thx
0	5 do fathers touch their daughters this way in affection
0	i get ashamed and feel weird when people talk about sex or joke about rape or molestation

0	There is hell on earth , not just after death
0	I thought it was strange but honorable
0	What really happened was he made arrangements to visit an old girlfriend
0	He was very cold and uninviting

0	And , I ca n't bear it any more

0	Help please
0	Neither of us has been able to handle intimate relationships with men
0	My sister dealt with life as a fighter , angry at the world , in pain inside
0	It still scares me to see a man get angry
0	Does witessing a man 's anger still scare you
0	Hi
0	However , that 's not my big problem
0	I was mature as a child , and rather tall and heavy
0	I weighed about 170 pounds as a kid
0	Ok , to the actual problem   I am very , very , very shy
0	People used to think I was mute
0	What was really weird is that I seem to have different personalities
0	I am never willing to talk to anyone
0	Ever
0	The only time I may like someone is if the person is through a computer screen
0	It 's sad
0	When I like an idol celebrity through the internet , It 's not just fondness
0	It 's an obsession
0	I get attached to celebrities really bad
0	So , do I have multiple personality disorder or what
0	Is there something very wrong with me
0	Is there some sort of online help I could get
0	Getting some help at school and i guess from two friends
0	My other friend is suicidal so ya
0	Ok so i like do n't really like very many things anymore
0	I m only interested in like a couple of things
0	Like i like writing screen plays and playing guitar
0	But besides that I would rather die
0	But i m pretty sure its never going to get better
0	I ve always dealt withthis
0	And now it just really hurts
0	like i pretty much take suicide as a one time thing
0	If your going to do it do it right
0	so like I m just not sure if it will work
0	Like a lot of family and a couple friends i do nt have many
0	So the only outing my 4yr old gets is grocery shopping day
0	Meanwhile my 12yr old goes out with friends 23 times a week
0	I know that there is something causing this
0	am I a horrible parent
0	is it really all my fault
0	I just ca n't understand

0	Initially I did want to work on it as it is a marriage and it takes time to adjust
0	Please advice and Many Thanks for reading
0	I feel neither dead nor alive
0	Rejection has been the theme of my life and the pain is not aleveated with medications nor therapy with psychologists or social workers
0	So
0	
0	
0	How do I make it
0	i'VE TRIED IT ALL
0	There seems to be no end in site
0	
0	I see no other way
0	I need practical advice
0	The therapy they say will help   just does n't
0	But it 's just not working
0	But how do I do that

0	I had open knee surgery
0	Like shouted at me
0	And their pain tolerance is higher so they can take less drugs
0	I never had a problem with addiction to drugs
0	Because he is not a shrink and does n't know anything about mental disorders
0	I think this is patient abuse in every single way
0	I do n't know about the pain though
0	Yes they make the pain go away but no
0	Although I 've been actively seeking a job and doing something on side as well
0	Seriously I do n't know what kind of doctor or monster does this to a patient who has anxiety problems and pain at the same time and just gotten over surgery
0	Because everyone thinks he is this great doctor
0	All the nurses do
0	I was devastated
0	But in a short time we were back together again
0	1 week
0	He was having family problems and was really depressed
0	So he needed space
0	I thought this is great
0	He was trying to date us both again for the second time
0	For the next 7 months things were great
0	We would bicker here and there about things but nothing serious
0	He did n't want to hear it
0	But she thought it was really creepy
0	I was in shock
0	After all of these months it was over
0	We would go out to dinner and hang out
0	Until I went looking for answers
0	But he still wants to be friends if that is possible
0	I was pissed
0	His whole life is nothing but one big   up
0	With who
0	Tracey
0	Why do n't I have someone
0	It makes me tear up just thinking about it
0	How intimidating is that
0	I could never work up the courage to call the cops
0	My mom just does n't get it
0	It upsets me so much
0	As a kid , I had to apologize for every family dilemma that had occured
0	Growing up , I never was involved in drinking or drugs
0	Abused
0	Abused by her and abused by myself
0	My mom is twofaced
0	It 's sickening
0	I 'm the terror
0	It frightens me
0	I do n't know what to do about that
0	The guy she was dating was nice but also creepy and questionable
0	It was a family friend
0	Well , recently , I found out it was true Down to the last detail
0	And the worst part is , during that time , my mom stayed with the guy A
0	Knowing my little sister was in danger
0	She is vile
0	I ca n't focus
0	I lose sleep
0	I change eating habits
0	I become introverted
0	I cut myself
0	I hit myself
0	I have suicidal thoughts
0	All because of her
0	You develop a complex
0	I 'm just searching for some help
0	I 'm at rock bottom
0	The bruise was large and almost black , but it 's gradually faded , but now I have a hard lump a bit smaller than a toy marble
0	, but I want testing done now
0	I 've known people who have developed or found sarcomas after traumatic injuries
0	How do I go about being screened without seeming like a hypochondriac
0	sorry for the bitter commentary , but I 've been through enough problems with doctors saying something was what it was n't , or was n't what it was
0	This is after countless appointments , 5 visits to the ER during attacks that were dismissed as heart burn and food poisoning
0	Potential cancer is n't like a gallbladder , it gets bad , FAST
0	I am irritable all the time , angry and empty
0	This emptiness has come and gone all my life
0	I am impulsive
0	Some things are too embarrassing to share
0	I have had paranoid episodes
0	It last for about a minute
0	My moods change all the time
0	There is no set pattern of my mood swings
0	My emotional states are extremely intense
0	Full of energy and life and inspiration
0	I am funny , witty and strong to most people
0	I like being the one people come to for support
0	There is a lot more but I want this post to be readable
0	I have read about the whole repressed memory thing and do n't know if it is true
0	Is there anyone else out there who has felt this way
0	Re you look HORRIBLE
0	that s a much better pic , but that skinny look , hope your not dying
0	that anemicbolemic kind of look Oh gee EVERYONE says hi huh
0	even Peanut

0	No need to answer that , or anything else
0	PS
0	keep on trying new pics , SOMETHING has to look like your not so damn anemic
0	BEE AH CH
0	and a giant one at that
0	goodbye good riddancehavior
0	I know these things can happen
0	Was n't too sure what category this falls under but this situation has made me really stressed
0	I am a 23 male healthy
0	However that was years ago
0	So it was an annoying guessing game
0	What should i do
0	should i continue to deny
0	shrug and act like that never happened
0	or should i lie to make it seem like it was really nothing like that
0	Do you agree
0	It 's true there is not comfort in the truth
0	Medicine is bitter
0	It 's so hard to mantain
0	That job has collasped later
0	My relations with any could damage
0	Different things could happen
0	Well I tried not to be angery or worry when someone is angry
0	But it 's all scientific that I get reflection of wavenot a bad wave when somebody get angry
0	But non of the things are bad from health point of view it 's just complex things
0	Next in sex and masturbate experiement
0	I spent long time in a smile environment
0	Ya obviously smile brings good harmone so feels easy but not perfect
0	This disease has not any perfect solutions
0	All the things are necessary and all the things are imperfect
0	So the best medicine for mental people is get mad time after time
0	Next amazing experiement
0	Many time i go to do sex
0	Actually what happened is if i do masturbate near the lady either it works as a sex
0	Because my wave reflects from lady 's body
0	But if i masturbate at home ,
0	then it works like a masturbate , it make nervous
0	This is amazing
0	Next thing whenever i try to feel any lady with love
0	I started to get sick
0	life is so complex
0	I have realised that psysic exercise is very very very important
0	This all started when I was married
0	I think the first thoughts were that
0	This is what happened
0	We divorced
0	Now its been 3 years and a lot of crying
0	Since then I also suffer from severe anxiety tight places like in a car , bus , or airplane
0	Before then I did n't have these issues
0	What is wrong with me
0	I 've never been on any drugs
0	This is obviously an emotional anger issue , blocked energy , or something , and needs natural treatment or healing
0	
0	Sory for being so long winded please bare with me
0	Firstly I 'll describe myself a little
0	I have only had one fully blown out panic attack but do get smaller ones quite often
0	Most of the time I am fine
0	I am physicaly very healthy and have a strong social life and by the most part am a happy upbeat person
0	I have an uncle who is a schizophrenic and several family members who have suffered depression
0	I excessively drink alcohol maybe once a week and smoke maybe a cigarette per day
0	I have in the past have had several fears
0	3 of those times I would consider myself as quite intoxicated by cannabis but not on the other occasions
0	This was maybe a week ago
0	It has become an obsession
0	There are no voices
0	I can hold myself in a conversation and still have a great interest in being sociable
0	I am not dellusional
0	I do not have delusons of granduer
0	I do not have emotional blunting or strange posture and a blank facial expression
0	I do not feel deporsonalization or hypersenstivity to criticism
0	I still have a high degree of personal care
0	I do not have suicidal thoughts
0	I just need someones thoughts
0	44 years old
0	So I have n't worried
0	Periods were regular usually every 2628 days
0	Lasting 3 days off one and back on for 1
0	Take thyroid and have been having to take Met since I delivered because the gestational never went away
0	Not sure I have that though
0	Started 17 days ago with some dark discharge blackish brown then it went to pale red with some blood clots but mostly was just spotting never saturated a pad
0	Just notice with wiping
0	Heavier flow
0	Normal for me
0	But cramping especially if I am , up trying to do stuff
0	Nothing in the middle , no Ultra sound , no , blood tests Just jump right into a biopsy
0	Although it seems I was having something abnormal and now just a regular menstral cycle on top of that
0	But I am , not sure
0	And now this Any thoughts
0	Any thoughts other than Uterine Cancer
0	Is it typical to have cramps with Uterine Cancer
0	Or should it have stopped it by now
0	It stops and starts again
0	This is one reason I am , more concerned
0	policemen , teachers , strangers in the street
0	I ca n't walk on the same side of the road as someone who looks scarydodgy and avoid walking near anyone else at all
0	a nail clipper   cutting up my flesh with it and blood everywhere
0	I used to do things that were self destructive
0	For awhile i could n't stop thinking about disappearing or committing suicide
0	Although i never acted on these
0	My sadness is different then before
0	I feel so lost all the time
0	Could these lingering symptoms be caused by depression
0	By anemia
0	By vitamin deficiencies
0	By inadequate thyroid medication dosage
0	I should have the energy to do everything
0	I do n't even know how to begin
0	He honestly believes there are aliens out there that are protecting us and are going to come and help us go from physical beings to light and vibrations
0	Our DNA is also going to change
0	To help us all ascend when the time comes
0	He almost went so far as to call himself a prophet
0	But then he 'll turn around and say there is nothing to be afraid of , it 's going to be beautiful
0	We wo n't need anymore earthly possessions
0	He says time travel is now possible
0	He says there is going to be an announcement on the news sometime soon that aliens have been discovered here on earth , living among us
0	He thinks aliens are causing the sun to have massive sun flares
0	He also says that those of us who do n't believe and do n't ascend are going to be put in concentration camps
0	That 's why the weather has been so warm
0	Oh and the government and aliens are all behind it
0	The government is crooked and out to take all our rights away
0	All the stores are going to be empty because gas is going to go up to 8 a gallon
0	So all the trucks will stop moving
0	I have not been able to look at the deed to see if this is correct , but that does n't matter
0	All caused by this HARP
0	Thank you
0	I am an overly sensative person
0	That people are out to get me
0	I never wanted to be alone
0	I do n't get hurt
0	I started using something else as a way to fill the void of abandonment
0	My cats
0	My love for animals
0	I have big anxiety issues
0	I understand with borderline feelings can change from love to hate a lot
0	And I use to do that
0	Like I have no emotions at all
0	Would I be sad
0	Would I cry
0	Now I ca n't even think
0	I 'm so apathetic about it
0	That I 'm the most useless person
0	How can anyone like me
0	I ca n't look at an animal anymore and feel something
0	And just a little while ago
0	I always been a caring person
0	When my old teacher died of cancer
0	I cried
0	And though this scares me another part of it does n't
0	I was bothered and still cam
0	But still I do n't know
0	I 'm apathetic
0	I do n't find myself feeling bad for people
0	Because I do n't feel like ME
0	I suffer from severe depression
0	Without meds I am suicidal
0	I noticed no side effects
0	Unfortunately it only lifted me up enough to not be suicidal
0	I was still quite depressed
0	During this time I did not notice any side effects
0	My mood improved dramatically
0	First there was itching
0	It began occuring in the evenings
0	There are no external symptoms
0	No redness or hives or anything else I can see
0	After an hour or two it usually passes
0	Mostly it is a discomfort in my tongue
0	It is hard to describe , it is not especially painful although it is definitely sore
0	It feels like it has been scraped against something rough and it is now tender
0	Most commonly it tastes like milk that has gone bad
0	Last but not least is the strange sensation that there are little things floating around in my mouth
0	And , much like the itching I described above there are no visible symptoms
0	Nothing in my mouth looks red or inflamed
0	There is n't anything that looks out of the ordinary
0	My question is this , has anybody experienced any of these symptoms before
0	If anyone actually responds or shows interest in it I would be happy to add that at a later date
0	She s kinda feeble
0	My life is so messed up smh am so ashamed and depressed ever since
0	Would someone give me some guidance and help please
0	Then a whole new world on adderall
0	Then anxious and agitated as it wears off
0	How did you successfully treat around the adderall
0	What did your doc do
0	My psychiatrist mentioned trying a thyroid med
0	But have n't got there yet
0	I 've partially weaned
0	Wondered if over time klonopin culprit for depression
0	I have lupus
0	Fun fun
0	Nonetheless the depression around the adderall has been there long time now

0	While I got
0	Little relief the pain did come back , accompanied by neck pain , joint pain and other muscle soreness

0	And the worst part is that I actually feel the symptoms
0	It 's not just paranoia and unreasoned fear of it
0	And nothing was wrong
0	But I ca n't avoid it anyway
0	I 'm scared
0	I 'm not afraid of dying

0	Please help me
0	Did n't think much about it

0	A suspect for Novovirus and Lyme are considered
0	However , I have no rashes , no flu like symptons and no fatigue
0	I am sure several more blood work will be done

0	Most doctors may not support that concept
0	My noutrition has always been good
0	thank you
0	First a bit about myself
0	No precancer at all detected
0	I go every year for a pap test
0	Fast forward a few years
0	I have been experiencing mild hot flashes from time to time as well
0	I knew this girl and was wondering whether someone could confirm or give some more information around whether what this girl wasis doing is normal
0	When asked whether it hurt and why , etc
0	she said no and seemed embarrassed
0	She does n't seem disturbed by this   just very secretive and tries to hide it
0	not groomed
0	at night
0	However , they have never ever been robbed
0	Her parents fight at home   still do and were very conservative and controlling ie
0	However , that 's stopped now
0	At school she is the odd one out and does n't have friends , tries to fit in , plus used to be quite rowdy around 78 but is very intelligent
0	Does this sound like she has been sexually abused
0	She is still secretive and tries to hide it
0	Please do n't suggest therapy   she is embarrassed and such and it might not help , especially if it is within the lines of normal
0	Or whether she was abused and ca n't recall
0	I have read about that , but would n't there be some sort of feeling
0	She really ca n't recall anything
0	Please give me some suggestions and advice
0	Thank you truly
0	Has anybody out there ever heard of this
0	He also has been for quite sometime a habitual liar

0	So , if anyone just wants to chat to calm down , maybe we can help each other

0	Hello everyone
0	The depression was triggered by a stressful situation at college , which also caused me a lot of stress and anxiety
0	I also decided to postpone college for one semester in order to get some rest
0	Plus , compared to feeling miserable and crying everyday , it was something I could tolerate
0	Honestly , my first reaction was OH NO , NOT AGAIN
0	Not another new medication
0	Sorry again for the long post help please
0	Recently I feel like it is getting much worse
0	I just on here about something called looping behaviors
0	I have so many questions
0	Do I have chronic stress , if so , why did the blood test rule otherwise
0	if not , why am i experiencing these signs   symptoms
0	Can blood tests really MEASURE cortisol or are there loop holes for cortisol to be hidden in certain factors preventing an accurate assessment
0	Hope I didin't bore anyone
0	I ca n't work
0	I tried

0	31 years old , female
0	am I crazy
0	  I 'm sad
0	this is not nice
0	it 's not cool , and it 's not right
0	what did I do in a past life to desrve this
0	nobody seems to want to share , but everyone has this look like oh   I do n't want to talk to this person
0	why wo n't anyone just TELL ME
0	do you feel like that
0	Period
0	what gives
0	ifeel like I 'm in hell right now
0	The back of my mouth has developed two white patches , one on each side , one larger than the other
0	I also have what looks like a red circular puffy bump on the side with the larger white patch
0	It also has a brownish yellow coating in places
0	She did not do any kind of swab
0	My research says that hpv is a cause of orphangyeal cancer
0	Do my symptoms sound like cancer
0	At the time a Doctor said it was most likely TMJ
0	Fast forward years later , and that lump is still there , but feels like it had gotten bigger
0	I did n't think too much of it after that
0	At first the face pain would happen once every 6 months or so , but within the last year it has progressed to a point that it occurs daily
0	I have taken gabapentin and tegretol with no relief
0	My blood test also showed elevated platelets , hematocrit , lymphocyte , and eosinophil counts
0	My question is can an oncologist tell it 's a salivary glandlymph nodecystneuromawhatever just by touch alone
0	Is it even worth getting a second opinion
0	Has anyone else experienced a similar interaction with a Doctor
0	I am not even sad
0	Even cutting stopped being affective which is a good thing I guess  
0	I do n’t know if that ’s depression
0	It has been like that for a long time , but not worse
0	Perhaps dysthymia
0	Afterwards I tried to squeeze the tip but nothing came out
0	I am thinking that it was pre   mixed with the lunrication from the condom
0	But it seemed more wet as usual
0	I have no idea
0	
0	He , of course , denies it
0	There is no evidence , no witnesses , and the found no reason for an arrest

0	I have bpd and the typical fear of abandonment

0	The feelings I have re
0	it are so intense that I ca n't even discuss it with anyone without crying like a baby
0	Does anyone have any advice that would make this any easier
0	I still have anger issues and abandonment issues , but it 's comparatively better
0	I do n't know how l feel
0	Like this big hole which ca n't be filled
0	I sort of brainwashed myself into it
0	I really need some reassurance
0	I am in a pickle
0	The woman i m in love with , is a long time love
0	We met very young , fell in love
0	WOW
0	we started dating and moved in together
0	Things were strange at first
0	I stayed in it and fell deeper in love
0	We had rocky times and broke up two more times
0	Quickly got back together
0	Who does n't
0	until one day on July 19 2015
0	But it ended us
0	we are older
0	we have nothing more to talk about
0	there has been not contact between us ever sense
0	  five days
0	Biting nails
0	sincerely , MattB
0	I either see blank or just all the bad things that could go wrong
0	I constantly worry about everything , little things and big things
0	But , I feel so worthless
0	I remember being lonely and hating everyone
0	I want to stop caring

0	I am getting all the possible help out there that 's available

0	i have nt had a friend or gone outside in over 2years
0	ill be the person living alone in the middle of nowhere dieing without anyone noing or going to my funeralim a no one and everyone noes that
0	My problem comes in with the ex though
0	I cry a lot and hejust wo n't be nice
0	Not going to talk bad about him or anything
0	That is not me
0	Of which at that time , he was married
0	What can I do
0	with them
0	8th grade started great , played a fall sport and reported that things were going well and he acted happy and looked forward to going to school
0	We spoke to the guidence counslor   the principal
0	Our son is a good looking kid , smiles   use to has a sense of humour   use to and is into sports
0	Towards the begining of the last marking period he began to have head aches , stomach aches and missed school
0	He also began to sit on the floor and break into tears and beg not to go to school
0	It looked to me like a emotional break down
0	He begged us to home school himHe promised to stay involved in outside acctivites , stay in contact with friends and do the work at home
0	There is always something wrong
0	Sorry this has been a ramble but things just pour out after awhile
0	LEAVE ME ALONE
0	Please give me an awnser
0	A little introduction on the topic is needed i guess
0	We would go everywhere together
0	you know the typical relationship which ended pretty much before it began
0	Well to make that short they are still together
0	they are always on the phone with one another
0	if not on the phone on the computer
0	we were both discusted
0	she also had a pregnancy scare as well
0	we found some webpages too looking up teenage pregnancy
0	why do 16 year olds not think of the responcibility of a child , like paying for diapers and formula and clothing , food , furniture , schooling , daycare
0	i have no idea
0	getting past that situation it took a week of calling school attendance , supervisors , principals , etc
0	just to get her accepted back into school in the middle of the second semester
0	i m sure there s more but those are the things that come to mind right now
0	or how i should handle this
0	sorry this is so long
0	
0	Hi
0	I 'm too depressed to even bother to attempt suicide again
0	So I just got back from holidays
0	I always feel really depressed after holidays for a long time
0	I constantly worry about things
0	Even little things will bother me
0	Who is gon na be there , like if it will be people i do nt know
0	Will i be in school
0	What kind of job
0	But then other moments , its like everythings gone and i feel fine
0	I feel quite happy sometimes
0	But then eventually it all comes back
0	So I do nt know if this classifies as depression or not
0	Thanks for taking your time and reading
0	The brother is sex offender and still goes around the family
0	Her butt crack is still very red
0	I 'm not sure into what to do
0	Linz
0	And last semester I got such bad grades not even above a 20
0	It was bad and I could n't handle it anymore , and finally decided to go back to therapy
0	I 'm doing much better
0	But I 'm afraid to go back to college
0	Please words of wisdom or advice will be greatly appreciated
0	But it did n't that night
0	It was really cold that night and I was frozen
0	I 'm so stressed out and scared
0	i do n't know what to do
0	I 'm so scared it will happen again
0	Where do I start
0	To be honest , our relationship was extremely toxic
0	Does anyone else have this problem
0	Any advice would be appreciated
0	Thank you
0	I have tried herbal relaxants and herbal antidepressants but to no avail
0	The most terrifying , embarrassing and confidence crushing experience ever and all in a bid to control it when in CBT
0	What on earth can i do
0	Anything from anybody will be much appreciated
0	The person had no idea until he stumbled upon photos on the assailant 's computer later on
0	These stories kind of make a person wonder about all the times they drank and blacked out or passed out
0	Is it possible to have been anally raped without any recollection if you were passed out from drinking
0	Would n't there be fragments or flashbacks if the person can remember most of the night 's events
0	2
0	Even if the assailant was careful to be gentle , would n't the person feel it the next day
0	3
0	What are the symptoms
0	If there were no sign of any of these symptoms when the person woke up the next day , is it still possible that it happened
0	If pschyaitry is a fraud , how many people are mentally ill and can not help it
0	If you are not competant to believe that someone is mentally challenged regardless of some stupid test to prove that thay are are not openmimded enough to see that not everything has to be conclusive on some kimdof test result regardimg the mindIf people could understand that it is a chemical imbalance wothim the brain and some kimdof cognitive play therapy are goimg to fix it can stick it
0	Thank you
0	I self harm , and have thought about suicide quite a bit
0	In the end she did n't
0	I did n't up fully understand why , and again took the guilt trip
0	I heard the whole thing
0	He pleaded not guilty and has to go back to court
0	Anyway , I do n't know what to do
0	In need of desparate advice
0	Please please please help
0	This is so very difficult to even share with anyone
0	This was never my plan
0	And Ii am one of those people who are trying everything else before they mak such a decision
0	I believe families should talk and resolve problems together
0	But , I will appreciate any word of advice
0	Thank you in advance
0	I would get upset or over sensitive and just explode in tears and frustration
0	Even so I was put on medication meant for ADHD
0	I did n't want to deal with that dependency forever
0	Things that usually upset or frustrate people
0	Thankfully it 's only happened in private so far
0	, What 's going on
0	, What 's wrong
0	will only make it worse , dragging it out painfully
0	It 's weird that people focusing in on it tends to make it so much worse than if they just left it alone
0	Another thing I ca n't figure out
0	Everything is absolutely fine , I have no reason to cry this much
0	Even medically I 'm fine , according to recent blood tests
0	I 'm not sad , or angry , or much of any one emotion
0	Nothing out of the ordinary other than when the situation calls for it
0	The character cries at inappropriate times yet maintains a calm , sometimes even upbeat attitude
0	It 's both funny and frustrating that possibly a made up condition is very , very real to me
0	I just do n't know what to do
0	So does anybody have a clue what 's going on
0	i had never heard a voice say this it
0	this is the only voice i ever hearthink
0	this did n't happen ever until i developed a fear of being schizophrenic
0	i can be around the kids and not hear anything
0	but once i think about having that thought , it happens
0	does this sound like schizophrenia or is this me being a hypochondriac
0	i m medically diagnosed as a hypochondriac
0	she has perfect skin , perfect teeth , perfect hair , perfect hight no boobs P and good grades
0	and gets alll the guys
0	i never did b4
0	help plz
0	He had to be brought down the stairs crying
0	This is oviously not normal
0	When asked why he would n't say why
0	And that was just to go to the dentist
0	Why is this happening
0	He cries and gets so upset
0	Like she needs the attenion   sympathy
0	Needs a story for everyone , pitty you may call it
0	I do nt understand it
0	I have heard that there is a medical term for thispeople that need that type of attention   sympathy
0	Looks for emotional crisis 's
0	Why thrive   look for things bad
0	And most of allWhy want me to be sick for attention
0	What is this called
0	Hope I have posted this correctly
0	Thank you
0	Any response on whether you think this lump could be cancerous or benign would be greatly appreciated
0	Hi , I am 45 almost 46
0	Then on Nov , 21st I got it again
0	All normal
0	The period finally ended
0	And no blood for 13 days
0	then I noticed a little blood and brown discharge again
0	then nothing
0	no period , no discharge
0	I read on a few websites that a dc is also a biopsy and that it is more accurate then an endometrium biopsy
0	and is it uncommon to get the small amount of blood and discharge and then nothing
0	how accurate is the endo biopsy anyway
0	how common are dcs and hysterectomies in peri menopause
0	thanks and any input would be greatly appreciated
0	please read on cuz I can use some education
0	Pliva
0	434number on pill , 4x 05 Clonazepam
0	and 6 pills light green in color and oblong in shape labeled with L2
0	Dunno about 'em
0	She 's 24
0	Her parents are very up front
0	Now , this I can not buy people can be emotional and not always be stoned
0	I read up , too
0	She 's doing just that
0	Things have improved
0	Now , who said anything about this
0	Now , here 's what scares me
0	I wo n't tolerate it
0	WHAT
0	I need more time
0	expresses no desire to do so
0	If someone really is experiencing a very hurtful situation , it 's common to cry a lot etc
0	but can this also be counted as a manic episode
0	hmmm
0	But the above scares me
0	COULD it be my gf has borderline personality and conciously manipulates situations
0	OR she can not control it and is sincerely sorry for outburst
0	help
0	help
0	I found deep inspiration in this song
0	Always
0	My opinion about myself is based on other people
0	I have trust issues
0	And with friends sometimes I feel left out
0	What 's wrong with me
0	
0	My theory is whether the neurobiological changes that appear on brain scans are more indicative of the way the neurochemistry has changed because of a reaction to something external rather then being assumed that the changes are proof that it has a genetic cause
0	It revealed one pilonidal cyst very high up , and lower down an unidentified mass , which the doctor doing the echo did n't know what it was
0	The mass can also be palpated with fingers , and it is somewhat rubbery but at the same time firm , and not very movable although it is somewhat movable , but in a limited manner
0	It is 16 cm long , 06 cm wide and located at a depth of 07 cm
0	What could this be
0	Also , chordoma seems to go beneath the sacrumcoccyx , whereas this lump appears to exist only above
0	Any ideas what this could be
0	Could it be chordoma
0	Thanks
0	I m just so over the whole deadbeat dad role
0	Abosolutly nothing
0	The Clozaril dosage is 300 mg and Zyprexa dosage is 20 mg
0	Both are taken at night
0	We drank and used drugs
0	I drank cough syrup for the first time to try to get high and hallucinate
0	It did not go well
0	There , a counselor came to determine whether I had tried to hurt myself or not
0	The doctor put me on Risperdal
0	This is when another big turn of events happened
0	I could define these thoughts as delusions
0	I also keep thinking of conversations that had never happened
0	They are quite painful
0	This puts me at even greater distress
0	I keep wondering , is it possible that the medicines are actually causing these thoughts
0	Since I no longer had a period after that , it was difficult to determine exactly when menopause started
0	Has anyone had this experience of hot flashes for such a long time and is there any hope they will stop anytime soon
0	Hi
0	Since then my periods have been horrible , often heavy , with diarrhea at times and bad cramps and clotting
0	Mostly they are regular
0	The next day no blood but very tired
0	Sunday not too bad
0	There 's no blood but I am very tired , jittery and moderate to bad cramps
0	Is this normal for perimenopause or menopause
0	Thank you very much

0	Maybe I tried to jump
0	I ca n't focus on this stuff sometimes
0	I guess , that 's just the way it is
0	I just do nt get it
0	At first , It seemed like a fairy tale of sorts because neither one of us had been in a previous relationship and neither one of us had any sexual relations with anyone before meeting each other
0	We were amazingly compatible in every way possible
0	We were pure , young , innocent , honor roll students , attractive , well behaved , no drinking or drug using , no partying even
0	Match made in heaven
0	A collection of porn my eyes had never seen
0	Thousands of movies in his computer
0	I could nt wear perfume
0	I couldn ' wear makeup
0	But at what cost
0	He later apologizes
0	Then says it again
0	But it was n't right
0	The abuse continued
0	We both started college
0	He pays everything
0	Today not much has changed
0	It 's not that easy to just GO
0	Guess I 'm stuck
0	I do nt know what to do
0	But on the other hand she can be sweet loving and happy
0	Please somebody what is her suffering

0	At 19 there was a diagnosis of Histrionic personality disorder , followed 2 yrs later with Bipolar and BPD
0	She starts off really well , then blows herself out of the water
0	Since no job , no insurance
0	Her behavior since the seizures began has just come down hill
0	K agreed to this
0	The slightest thing sets her off
0	K was taken back to psych hosp
0	and put in acute ward with 15 minute checks
0	No broken neck and MRI ok Wnated A neuro consult , and awful doc was on call
0	When she was wheeled downstairs to be taken back to the psych hosp
0	She 's still very weak
0	These was the sweetest baby and child that ever was
0	Every thing with puberty
0	She needs so much help
0	Please help if you can , Lulabel
0	Hey
0	Do I need to go to a psychologistpsychiatrist or just having a more full everyday life would help to erase those thoughts
0	It almost feels as if the prozac is no longer working because I still get so depressed
0	can someone please give me some advice on how to handle this situation
0	Thank you very much in advance
0	I feel very lonely
0	I do n't have many friends , well none really
0	The voices say , you 're a loser
0	, and You 're going to burn in hell
0	I need help
0	I feel worthless , and extremely insecure
0	She had a bowel movement , and screamed
0	Please , any suggestions are very much appreciated
0	Thanks
0	At that time , it was round , about the size of a nickle , and hard , but did not hurt
0	He ordered a round of bloodwork as well as an ultrasound
0	The bloodwork came back mostly normal
0	The exception was the MCHC was 24 below normal range
0	Also , MCV was 04 above normal range
0	I just received the ultrasound results
0	Here 's the gist of the report There are three hypoechoic regions extending from the skin toward the deep axillary tissues progressively increasing in size superficially to deep
0	Superficially a 4 mm x 3 mm hypoechoic region is seen
0	In the deep tissues a 7x 7 mm hypoechoic region is identified
0	There is some colorflow associated with the more proximal superficial lesion
0	These do not have imaging characteristics typical of cyst or lymph node
0	An unusual neurogenic tumor can conceivably have this appearance
0	I doubt that this represents an inflammatory mass
0	Over the last 5 days or so , the underarm area has increasing become tender and bothersome
0	I still would n't label it as painful , but it 's definitely sore
0	Does anyone have any insight on this kind of thing
0	Thanks
0	I am a busy primary school teacher who has just finished a MEd while working full time
0	The doc suggested stress and over work
0	depression

0	To my high school sweetheart
0	A few years went by then the abuse and controlling started

0	Hi all
0	I have found myself in a very serious , very depressing situation , and am looking for advice
0	My husband took out a 25 000 loan to start a computer repair business
0	We have had to take out loans from the bank and borrow money from family just too survive
0	It 's like it did n't even cross his mind to go work
0	I 'm just do tired of the never ending pattern
0	A little history first
0	2004 mass in breast removed , benign
0	Fast forward to recent
0	They are not growing but not going away either
0	later on these voices began telling me to manipulate people for things , like drugs or alcohol or even affection
0	I 'm thinking of requesting to have no funeral , it would just be a waste of their money anyways
0	Would seeing someone even be worth it
0	my self esteem was damaged yrs ago
0	Help
0	I have not really been on any forums before , and just wanted to get some advice
0	I am female
0	To cut a long story as short as possible , he has had a difficult childhood , with physical , emotional and sexual abuse , and struggled with school
0	He has been inolved in a lot of violence , been in and out of prison for reckless behaviours like drugs , driving etc
0	They two children
0	bullying behaviour , degrading comments and insults from him all the time
0	He thinks in a ' black and white ' fashion , described by other people who suffer with this condition
0	All the people he associates with are young lads etc
0	that do n't work and are alcohoics or drug addicts
0	He has also had couple of suicide attempts and threatened suicide on occasions
0	Sorry it is long
0	Thank you
0	He filed and moved out
0	The divorce has been really nasty
0	We have a wonderful life
0	But I have issues that stem from a unloving mother and not being able to trust women
0	I 'm the oldest
0	They all stick together thru thick and thin no matter what horrible thing is said to one other
0	But meI get tossed away
0	Our two sons are successful
0	We do n't live near each other anymore
0	She does n't feel a need to be in touch
0	How do I get over the anger and mistrust of people
0	I 'm at a loss
0	I cry a lot
0	I have no real close friends
0	How do I heal myself
0	This has been pretty consistent for about a year
0	Now , this may be completely disconnected to this but I might as well add it encase it 's important
0	I also get hurt insanely easily
0	Like , I 'm clumsy , yeah
0	But if I fall and get a scrape , it 'll become a scar no matter how bad it is
0	Sometimes the circumstances of a breakup and the animosity that men who are at this personal identy stage overide accountability or responsibility for the havoc it wrecks on so many others , they tend to be otherwise entertained
0	i have the recipts for at least 90 of the stuff in there
0	It 's going to take a pretty big truck to haul that stuff off
0	This is going to be a bit long just a fair warning
0	She was always a stay at home mom
0	This went on for another 5 months
0	He did n't seem very happy tho
0	I was in complete shock
0	It 's been difficult writing this
0	I often find myself looking for mother figures which sounds really weird
0	It 's really weird
0	Is it normal for me to feel depressed
0	What am I supposed to do
0	What am I supposed to feel
0	What am I supposed to say
0	Who am I supposed to be
0	Who am I
0	My whole life , at this moment , is a mess
0	A chaos
0	A huge mountain of chaos
0	It 's just too much for me to deal with
0	Too much for me to face
0	At least , I thought so
0	Till last week
0	A few little cuts to deal with the stress from an art project for school
0	Another portion of pressure and stress to add to the pile
0	A pile too big and too heavy
0	I started cutting again
0	I went on , even when it was hurting like hell
0	It hit me like a rock
0	The fear , the guilt , the loneliness , the hate , the weakness , the stupidness
0	The dirty and painful reality
0	I felt so alone , so hurt , so much in need of a hug
0	So I cried myself asleep
0	But I was a stupid coward
0	That 's the reality that I ca n't ignore anymore
0	The reality I have to face
0	But how the hell am I gon na get out of this mess
0	How am I gon na survive this any longer
0	
0	I am wondering if the heavy marijuana use is the cause of the depression or if it has anything to do with the start of puberty since it runs in the family
0	The depression came after the start of my chronic marijuana use
0	Transferring schools a be scary or intimidating for some children , but just because something is foreign does n't necessarily make it bad
0	For other children a change is welcomed with open arms and often appreciated
0	I was one of those children
0	I have been to six different schools , in two separate counties
0	Each with their own pros and cons
0	That thing was rejection
0	Something that has always been a fear of mine
0	Seventh grade flashed by as well and that boy was still the only one I thought about
0	As a seventh grader I was in awe
0	It all began with a school change , and a new group of people that I had to become friends with
0	The class took a trip to Washington , DC in September
0	That was full of many adventures and stories that I am not so proud of
0	I am not sure what started that , possibly jealousy or something of that sort
0	And this seventh grade crush came through for me
0	A guy took advantage of that over the summer and used that to benefit himself
0	Or at least that 's what I was told
0	But I guess relationships only last a while
0	This immediately caused me to freak out
0	After that I ended up seeing the actual Gynecologist
0	Like would her judgement have changed
0	Please someone help me decide what s rational and what is n't
0	Went to ER for what I thought was kidney pain
0	Somewhat elongated , measuring at least 16 x 08 cm
0	Also notes in the left lower abdomen there is suggestion of some very hazy vague increased attenuation in the mesentery around loops of small bowel , not necessarily in the central mesentery but just lateral to some loops of small bowel , which is of unclear etiology
0	Should I worry
0	Not great docs in my city
0	Thanks for any answers
0	We 're both 41 now
0	We are both highly educated and have achieved professionally success
0	Regardless , we got pregnant right away and that was great
0	Due to him cheating
0	Anyhow I called it quits
0	Not taking me their mother into any consideration
0	Its been a long while since our divorce
0	I 've got 2 sisters whom are also divorced
0	They get along great with their exeshow is that done

0	This , of course , has left me extremely concerned and scouring Dr Google for answers bad idea

0	It is not warm to the touch nor is the surrounding skin reddened at all
0	My main concern stems from family and the past
0	A close relative was recently diagnosed with rectal cancer and another relative recently had a benign brain tumor removed
0	Also , after searching the web , I did notice that mononucleosis could be a related issue with this as well

0	Hi there
0	Lets face it , Medhelp can be a tad bit depressing sometimes for all , whether posting or assisting with an issue
0	Getting lost in a hobby or the discussion of same , can be quite a relief
0	I was thinking that it would be great to start some forums based on similarities and interest , to kind of help with all the heavy stuff
0	Maybe if alot of members post , the mods will take it more seriously
0	Thanks in advance and take care
0	Anna
0	Things were goodnormal for many years
0	There were outbursts of yelling andor breaking things but they were few and far between
0	Now for several years things have cyclically gotten worse
0	There are weeks or months of good , normal times and then the same of just walking on eggshells
0	What kind of mood are we in , what is going to start a rant , etc
0	Always turns it around
0	History is grander than it actually was
0	People always copy him
0	He is very black and white about things
0	He never sees any gray
0	Against bpd He is not clingy
0	Thanks for all insightand please let me know if there 's any other info that would be helpful to know
0	Not the first time , infact it 's been going on since as far back as I can remember
0	I 'm in the metal health field but ca n't seem to get outside of myself on this one and see what everyone esle seems to see
0	Okay , enough procratinating
0	Now onto the really hard stuff to saythis is hard
0	I enjoyed sex
0	I got married at 26 and soon after started having health problems
0	When it started I soon lost ALL sexual drive and had no interest in it at all
0	Here 's my problem
0	I always said NO way
0	I 'm so embarassed and humiliated that this is so obvious
0	i do n't even remember further back past the age of 6 or so except for a few occurances
0	The therapist agrees that there is no point in trying to recall these kinds of past memories to remember who what or where
0	The problem
0	She explained it like thissexual abuse to a child is beyond painfultorcherous
0	Makes sense
0	And what do I do
0	We instantly hit it off
0	I felt the same way
0	The first few times visiting her home it was very orderly and well put together
0	Sometimes this would express itself as intense anger at work or other people though never directed at me
0	These things seemed trivial to me at the time
0	She had recently stopped taking antidepressents
0	We took a break at this point
0	This event caused us to begin spending a great deal of time together which brought us back into a relationship
0	Things were fine and felt good
0	About a month into this time the sexual aversion started
0	This did not help
0	I had it at this point
0	I kept it very friendly to this point as well
0	I did so and kept it friendly without making any sexual advances
0	Since then we have had no contact
0	Thanks
0	1 Minuite I think it 's all a load of rubbish , on that track of thought the illness has been made up so proffessionals can throw ' akward ' people in a box
0	Please ' elp me
0	I 'm scared
0	Beanie
0	I am very happily engaged
0	Why
0	ALSO I am obsessed with trying to get pregnant
0	I try and try and it just does n't happen
0	and I will miss a period and hope that it finally happened , but it never does
0	Please help me
0	It just went on becoming worse as days went by
0	That did nt matter much but the real problem was at school
0	It was just before recess
0	Everone saw me crying but no one cared to ask and just walked out of the doors
0	But i was completely broken and felt lonely
0	It felt like i was going on asking weird questions to myself
0	It was really frustrating i do nt even know how to explain it
0	It disappeared later with a few ayurvedic medications
0	I still feel anxiety , get irriated soon
0	I do nt know what to do anymore
0	But i just could n't get out of this
0	I also have been taking medication risperdal
0	Please anybody with a similar experience who could give me some advice would be help
0	It 's not pleasurable but it usually does the job
0	Now it does n't as well as before
0	But I need to sleep
0	Will this get better , as my face is lookin zombie like with lack of sleep not handy for the moods Anyone taking this have advice
0	Many thanks
0	I have considered it many times , suicide
0	Only attempted it once though
0	I was crying and laughing hysterically and just spazzing out over nothing in particular
0	Luckily , the scissors just bruised me
0	I keep these sort of things to myself usually , because some people can be really judgemental
0	I feel , to be frank , pretty
0	Please help
0	Thanks
0	hi there
0	i am open to thoughts and suggestions
0	my friends have been very supportive
0	This is a weird one
0	The problem is , the longer I resist it , the worse the need gets
0	I went to get help for it and was diagnosed as cyclothymic
0	Everything seems to make me want to cry
0	I can not put myself any further into debt to get medical help
0	Any ideas
0	Around New Year 's Eve I got ill and was off school for a long time
0	Soon the actual illness went away and healthwise I was better
0	Something unexplainable
0	I do , but this feels like something else
0	This is different to anything I 've ever felt
0	My habits were sheltering myself by feeling sick , compulsive eating , lack of studying and putting off human interaction among many other habits
0	Mostly I think everything turns around the aspect of school
0	How can I change , grow and suceed in such an environement
0	I feel the need to move , change systems , countries , circles to be able to be myself without doubting everyone and anyone
0	My parents do n't seem to understand that
0	There is decrease in the size of previously seen heterogeneously enhancing mass in right upper alveolus extending into right upper gingivobuccal sulcus and buccal mucosa measuring approximately 34 x 17 x 32 cm previous 7 x 25 x 35 cm
0	Posteriorly it involves the upper aspect of the right retromolar trigone with extension into masticator space showing loss of fat planes with temporalis , medial pterygoid and masseter muscles
0	The lesion creeps along the retroantral space into right low anterior ITF
0	Medially the fat planes with the lateral border of tongue is lost
0	There is erosion of outer cortex of maxillary alveolus
0	The mandible appears intact
0	The high ITF is free of disease
0	Few subcm sized lymph nodes are seen in right level II and bilateral level Ib
0	No suspicious enlarged necrotic nodes are seen
0	The rest of the oral cavity appears unremarkable The nasooropharynx , larynx and trachea appears normal
0	The parotid and submandibular glands appear normal
0	The thyroid gland is unremarkable
0	The orbits , mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable
0	CT reveals   Decrease in the size and extent of previously seen heterogeneously enhancing mass in right upper alveolar region as described
0	Subcm level II and Ib nodes
0	My question here really is could this be can cer
0	Every doctor I 've seen is n't worried at all
0	Well , I 'm actually eleven
0	And the Mother , Is just a lifeless zombie
0	Today is halloween
0	We immediatley knew what was going on
0	Police and everything had showed up
0	But nothing had happened
0	Her father has just a bout taken us everywhere
0	Busch Gardens , Universal , Sea World A lot of places
0	And everytime we all had fun
0	He 's a very generous man
0	I never really had a father
0	He was nice , funny , infact hilairious
0	But in the midfifth grade , she opened up everything
0	Right across the face
0	But it 's not just physical , its also verbal
0	Her mother , growing up , was also abused
0	Besides that she is just a sick woman
0	Her new husband is pretty lifeless too
0	He never at all smiles
0	But this man is worse
0	Which makes him look even more like a tough person
0	How could someone be so coldhearted
0	To light a PUPPY on fire
0	I was n't surprised to hear such a thing like this
0	Before she could get hurt
0	Right now , she 's in danger
0	Little Piece of   worthlessstupidretartedetc
0	And it has really been bothering my friend
0	Methadone , Oxxycotton , Oxycodone
0	And they were all gone , already
0	The step dad always shakes his leg , vigourously
0	And her mother sleeps 247
0	It 's not a good environment at all
0	That , right there , is a hint of immatureness
0	There is one coming up Wednesday November 2nd
0	I just need some advice
0	Should I go to court , and testify
0	Hi
0	They will be heavy sometimes and light other times
0	This started about 3 yrs ago
0	All these problems started happening
0	Missed periods , unusual headaches , and even real bed UTIs
0	I have even been getting real upset over nothing
0	Just wanted to know if anyone had any advice
0	Thank you so much
0	Hi , well
0	I do nt even know where to start
0	I have tons of problems
0	It sound so lame , but I 'm sick of everything
0	All I ever loved or wanted is two thousand miles away
0	Do you think this is fair
0	I 'm so depressed and guilty
0	Life do n't seem worth it now
0	which lead onto touching each other and kissing
0	This really did n't go on for long and it just stopped
0	Do i deserve to be living this lifestyle
0	I feel wrong to do so
0	to also have friends , be around family , animals in general
0	i feel so guilty to be around these
0	Hello , Just a little background
0	My fatigue is milder this time around , but brain fog is still pretty bad
0	Does the same SSRI work the second time around
0	Hello
0	It ’s a bit of an evil paradox as you can see
0	I love reading fantasy books
0	Which , because I ’m stuck here
0	Writing this just makes me feel pathetic , stupid and naïve
0	But I ca n’t stop wanting this
0	I ca n’t stop longing for it
0	And I just hate myself because of it
0	Well , yes , I do have a very low selfesteem
0	I find myself a coward and simply pathetic
0	I feel guilty a lot
0	I truly am an awful friend
0	I just want to be alone
0	But I ca n’t help it
0	And why ca n’t my sister be happy
0	She deserves a lot better
0	I just do n’t know what to do
0	I often ask myself that
0	“ Or am I just an attentionseeker
0	Is it just part of being a teenager
0	Does everybody go through this
0	Gods , I hate this
0	I do nt know what to do
0	What should I do
0	So to make a long story short I am freaking out
0	Thanks Claire
0	Sorry in advance for the long rant
0	The tidal wave of disappointment hit so hard   suddenly that I was n't prepared for it
0	I want a baby with this man so much
0	or just ignore me completely
0	So need a new start FAR away from here but I ca n't afford it
0	Getting phone numbers , work locations   addresses
0	I forgave those messages but now feel like an idiot because obviously nothing has changed
0	Not even when we were separated were there messages to ANYONE that were flirting , claiming cheating or saying things that should n't be said
0	Hell there were NO messages to men period I believe during that time unless it was a family friend checking in
0	What would you do
0	We have 4 kids between us , 3 of which that live with us
0	The oldest that lives with us has ADHDODD   the middle child has Cerebral Palsy
0	Thanks for any   all help   again sorry for the long rant
0	Even the good guys have put me through this situation
0	Thank you for reading whoever finishes this
0	So , I have this cycle that seems to repeat itself every once in a while
0	Generally I 'm a pretty relaxed person , and the first to crack a joke , and the first to laugh at a joke somebody else tells
0	I 've been to counsellors before , but never really taken anything from it
0	I 'm looking for any insight that people may have , maybe people who have had the same problem as this who found a way to get over it are willing to provide some
0	That 's all for now , thanks in advance
0	I have depression
0	I randomly hear a voice
0	Not sentences , just one word I 've heard weird things or simple like   hi , shower , oi
0	Another time I felt something a bit like a babies arm
0	I have had another experience feeling what seems to be cold skin
0	I can have weird and scary dreams
0	Or just normal things like future and working
0	Mainly are scenario 's
0	I 'm quite creative
0	I do dance , art , guitar
0	Stuff most probably not linked with schizophrenia I dohave self harmed
0	Madison1995
0	He has guilt with that
0	AND 6 months after that , another close friend passed away from an overdose
0	So , with that said , he has had a traumatic time with loosing people
0	It was after all this that my son just lost all sense
0	I have clearly stated no pot , no drugs , no alcohol
0	VERY clearly
0	Well , they drink anyway
0	And it gets violent with them
0	HUGE mistake
0	My husband   well   is verbally abusive
0	Neither of them have that right and there is no excuse   but
0	They both are verbally abusive and many times at the same time
0	Really
0	LOL   really
0	I am not scared
0	I want so badly to walk away
0	The abuse is just more than I can take anymore
0	It is from two people now , not just one
0	No confidence , no self esteem
0	I have no way out
0	I get anxious over everything
0	Another thing is hearing and seeing things that other 's do n't
0	I smell things others ca n't as well
0	Instead of acting out , they act in
0	Which I do
0	I would be an acting out
0	I see the world in a deeper way than others
0	Everything seems to have a meaning or at least in my head it does
0	Someone say 's anything remotely bad it stays with me forever
0	I would really really appreciate it
0	Please help , It may be another while before I see a psychiatrist
0	Just please help

0	As far as possible , without surrender , be on good terms with all persons
0	Avoid loud and aggressive persons they are vexatious to the spirit
0	Keep interested in your own career , however humble it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time
0	Exercise caution in your business affairs , for the world is full of trickery
0	But let this not blind you to what virtue there is many persons strive for high ideals , and everywhere life is full of heroism
0	Be yourself , Especially do not feign affection
0	Neither be cynical about love for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass
0	Take kindly the counsel of the years , gracefully surrendering the things of youth
0	Nurture strength of spirit to shild you in sudden misfortune
0	But do not distress yourself with dark imagin ings
0	Many fears are born of fatigue and lone liness
0	Beyond a wholesome discipline , be gentle with yourself
0	And whether or not it is clear to you , no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should
0	With all its sham , drudgery and broken dreams , it is still a beautiful world

0	I simply said   how old is this man
0	Not sure how to deal with the situation
0	I never got an apology
0	He never says it
0	If it deliberately put is hand up or if it was a freak accident but I ended up with a busted bottom lip and fell to the floor shocked and crying
0	Will it get worse , am I exaggerating
0	my mom is getting marryed again
0	the guy she is marrying is a jerk
0	she also does not understand
0	she gets everything then braggs about it
0	I feel worthless hopeless

0	i amso stressed with work as a graphic designer n organizer that sometimes it takes a complete day to do things
0	n wo nt let me talk on the phone with clients
0	sometimes will b to a extreme
0	my husband works part time
0	n he is usually sitting on the computer or watching tv
0	hv no family which seems not a really healthy family
0	However this is serious , the objective was to describe someone is emotionally , mentally , or physically unstapled there 's a specific word for it and it a serious condition in which someone has trouble adjusting to society
0	It likes this scenario one 1
0	A boy is furiously upset with himself because he has now become a paraplegic because of a car accident that occurred while being driven to school
0	Do you recommend any good reads
0	I’M REALLY INTRESTED IN MENTALITY
0	Thank you
0	And I had never experienced that before
0	I loved it
0	He seemed sooperfect
0	But once we found a place to stay , things got tense
0	I did n't like it at all and it really pulled us apart
0	Only because I am one of those girls that has confidence , not to much and not to little
0	And since moving there everything just kept going down hill more and more
0	Bit now the past two months things have n't been so good
0	But I just feel like such a pile of crap
0	Because he is really immature when it comes to talking
0	I am feeling extremely stressed at the moment
0	Does anyone have any suggestions or similiar experiences that could help me
0	This is going to be very long but please bear with me
0	and a computer
0	They do n't seem to be working though
0	He seems to have a problem with wiping the seat or flushing a second time if it does n't go down
0	He then storms out of the house blabbering gibberish and throwing tantrums all around the neighborhood
0	Also , by the way , he has an addiction and is not willing to over come it for nobody
0	This is my first breakup and why does it take so long
0	
0	I 've even tried meditation and yoga

0	I read lots about abusive mothers
0	Daughters who have to deal with mothers who are heartless , critical , alcoholic , verbally mean , and on and on
0	It 's horrible
0	But what about the mothers who have daughters like this
0	But you do n't see posts about us much
0	My daughter is one of these daughters
0	These girls who cry out because they have such dysfunctional mothers seem to be so productive , educated , trying , and obviously in pain
0	She was hell to raise
0	Always in trouble
0	NOt very empathic
0	NO conscience to speak of
0	Anywayshe is like from another planet
0	She dropped out of high schoolmy family is all educated
0	She has all friends with jail records
0	My family is all successful and productive
0	My family has No alcohol , no abuse , no crimejust normal old baggage
0	Why did she turn out like this
0	Unlike extreme religious people , or some rigid psychology academics believe , this is not anyone 's fault , and not from a lack of love , good environment , or abandonment
0	And please , whoever responds to this do n't bother responding if it 's going to be go to churchand spare me the god stuff
0	This is about personality disorders folks and no church in the world is going to change that or kiss it and make it better
0	The thing is , a parent with a child like this has no outlet
0	You are in for a life of pain
0	And a child with an emotionally stunted mother is just as bad off
0	I feel very bereft about this
0	I have no friends with daughters like this
0	I am never going to know what the joy is all about in having children
0	You are not to blame
0	You must protect yourself and not expect too much
0	For any moms out there with daughters like mineI say the same
0	Try to find a surrogate
0	Maybe Big Sisters of Americamaybe volunteering somewhere where there are mothers who lost children and would love to befriend a young girl
0	Best of the best to all of the readers on here who are hurting
0	Empty
0	She sighed and did n't say anything
0	It just happens
0	Her exact words
0	Mental health issues are also very very common in my family
0	There have schizophrenics , people with anxiety , depression , and autism in almost everybody in my immediate family
0	My partners mother shows many behaviours of BDP
0	She interprets everything incorrectly and accuses people of the most horrendous things
0	He is miserable , and is stuck in a terrible position
0	We are so confused , can anyone suggest anything at all
0	We are very worried
0	Please advise
0	He is a non insulin dependent diabetic , has hypertension , alcoholic and also has hypothyroidism
0	What can I do
0	Could the excessive alcohol be bringing this on or the depression
0	Hello dear doctors , I am a man , aged thirty
0	I also practice sport regularly
0	Immediately afterwards , I fell sick
0	He prescribed multivitamins effervescent , medicine containing magnesium , and some capsules for the stomach
0	I almost DIED
0	I had the same symptoms , except diarrhea
0	It was the most horrible experience I went through
0	I visited the same general practitioner
0	At times I feel nauseous
0	No one to rescue me if something bad happens
0	I do n’t know what to do
0	Any recommendations please
0	Thank you so much in advance

0	Hey , thanks for your advice , it 's nice to know there are people out there in the same situation

0	Probably since the 1st grade at least
0	I started out on Adderall
0	It was the little yellow pill
0	The Concerta was probably 36 mg which gradually increased to 56 mg and finally 72 mg in about 7th or 8th grade
0	Then the Concerta
0	When the first decrease happened I went from 72 mg to 56 mg
0	to 18 mg
0	I am experiencing withdrawals
0	Still , something does not seem right
0	Am I doing this safely
0	Should I have done something different
0	Not so much depression or thoughts of hurting or killing my self
0	But more of the idea that if I died it would n't be such a scary thing
0	I do n't feel sad , just not afraid
0	Things like hang gliding or skydiving
0	Or am I just happy to be off of the meds
0	I just want to go to sleep and not have to wake up anymore
0	I really hate it
0	I want to be normal
0	I hate feeling so depressed
0	I never understood the difference between upset and depressed until now , there is nothing anymore
0	Please does anyone know what i can do

0	PLEASE HELP
0	My abdomen is tender to touch , and sometimes feels hard
0	I 'm not pregnant , correct
0	Background on myself
0	None of it was on the severe side except possibly the emotional abuse
0	Our household was very controlled and no room for errors
0	My whole life seems like it 's been one huge lie
0	Growing up , faking everything
0	This has resulted in me despising any type of lying
0	I 'm extremely hard and critical on friends
0	I have very few friends , most of which are guys
0	Is it just learning to seperate what I grew up in with what is actually considered the norm life
0	Sorry , I kind of got to rambling there
0	Thanks for any input at allBe kind
0	At first it did n't phase me
0	But then I thought about it more and more
0	And more odd memories came back to me
0	Ranging from about the age of 8 to 14
0	But never were any of them
0	From want
0	But just plain curiosity
0	Everyone does things like that as a child and you develop
0	Having more unwanted intrsusive thoughts
0	I have the common knowledge of whether a guy has good looks and whatnot
0	Every man does
0	Socially its just not accepted so their afraid to admit it
0	I could nt get aroused
0	But the fact that it was a guy just was n't appealing to me
0	I tried downloading this stupid grindr app and trying to get myself to do it
0	But it scared me so much
0	My stomach dropped
0	My grades dropped
0	I just want to be happy and confident with myself again and get ky life started
0	There 's more
0	But heres the jist of it
0	Idk if this is also just a hormonal stage or a phase
0	It 's just affected my life as a whole
0	and I need help
0	I tried therapy
0	But I did n't go often enough so it did n't help
0	and sometimes i use the word cute instead of handsome , hot rarely
0	but idk if that changes anything
0	thank youAnd sometimes I have like this weird urge to give oral
0	But it goes away
0	And then comes back
0	But in the end I really do n't and whenever think of anything like that
0	Once I masturbate all the urges are gone
0	it disgusts me
0	So Idk if I 'm just hormonal or if its just natural and it happens to everyone at some point
0	I want to marry a womanplease help
0	The main problem is his ADD
0	The Vyvanse was working well for the first 3 years at 30 mg but has had to increase it through the years to 70 mg
0	The dr tried Ritalin and Nuvigil sp

0	I am extremely sensitive , tactile and emotional
0	I will feel sooo bad and worry cause of the smallest things
0	HELP
0	and what should I do
0	HELP PLEASE
0	Hi
0	Read all please
0	I 'd say it was a little before then that it started
0	But it has always been an issue
0	It was so complex and I hated to forget something
0	I still hate forgetting things
0	It 's dreadful
0	But there are plenty of things I do talk to myself about
0	Some things are simple things , like television or music
0	But a lot of things tend to be things that really stress me out
0	I 've spent whole days trying to say and word one thing
0	That is very stressful , and even when it 's simple things , I get stressed
0	I just ca n't enjoy myself
0	And I often force myself to talk about something or repeat was has been said
0	I force myself to do a lot , actually
0	It just , it does n't seem right or normal
0	None of it
0	We all talk to ourselves from time to time , but complex lists and constant , sometimes forced and repetitive conversations with myself
0	I 'd like to know what is normal and what is n't
0	Thank you , truly
0	Whenever I research , it points to some form of cancer
0	This feeling has not gone away
0	My doctor said it was due to stress from worrying about the Hepatitis B too much and running to all these doctors
0	She is a only child and get 's treated like a 2yr old
0	Any advice is welcomed
0	For some reason , I ca n't seem to tolerate AD meds
0	It 's still going on now and it 's got to the point where I just ca n't stand the sight of these people
0	Occasionally they ask ' What 's wrong with it '
0	They grew up together , and were extremely close
0	It hit him extremely hard
0	This past week , though , it 's gotten much , much worse
0	Will 's regressed further and further and he 's like a robot now
0	More indicators of just how bad this situation is
0	It was scary , because he 's never done that before
0	Ever
0	I 'm terrified
0	The thing is , though , that he refused to go
0	Point blank
0	How would I even go about doing that
0	But would that make things even worse
0	Would it completely destroy our relationship
0	Please help me
0	I was diagnosed with ADHD , depression , and anxiety not sure if generalized or social
0	Celexa initially worked well — felt genuinely happy and anxiety mostly disappeared
0	I like that it reduces anxiety , but it does n't help with depression at all anymoreaside from decreasing rumination and selfdefeat
0	Introducing Adderall helps substantially with my attention , socializing , cognition , learning , and interest
0	However — toward the evening after an XR dose usually 8 hours later — the negative effects of Celexa previously listed worsen
0	Then the following day is marked by apathy and irritability
0	Symptoms improve after one day of no Adderall and a break helps prevent tolerance
0	The ideal treatment plan would allow for a decreasing of depressionapathy , anxiety , and attentiondeficiency
0	The current cocktail I 'm on gives rise to too many counterproductive sideeffects
0	What should I do
0	The whole thing was ugly and painful
0	The pregnancy was extremely difficult and I was in and out of the hospital 4 times
0	It is like a bad TV show , but we are grown adults
0	She deserves better
0	How do I deal with that
0	It is so hard to know what to do
0	All my best
0	What do you all think
0	what kind of pain is it
0	When i open the needle and fix it the nurse put the 2nd needle again in the same table where the first needle was placed
0	We are only two in the room and one patient is waiting outside
0	There is nothing in the table that time
0	2
0	3
0	Currently under tremendous stress due to family and work situation
0	Did CTAbd , plevis , and other endoscpopy , colonscopy
0	Docs did not find anything wrong
0	Had a heart attack like situation in April and was rushed to hospoital in ambulance
0	Docs did CT of chest but could not find anything
0	Docs did not say it was emphysema at that time
0	Later , Abd , Pelvis CT scans reported that the lower lungs seen in scans do show moderate bullous emphysema
0	Based on that the Pulmonoloist ruled that it is not Emphysema
0	It is kind of increasing
0	Guys , please help me
0	Could it be just stress as it was causing a lot of other things
0	I am so confused now
0	Has anyone experience this
0	Any suggestions
0	Regards , GiJo
0	I just ca nt do it
0	help to get me motivated
0	Thanks
0	My only symptoms for having the hysterosocpy were slight spotting and brown discharge , and an ultrasound that showed irregularities of the womb lining though the lining was only 4 mm
0	r u listening n i said yes
0	Thankfully I was very blessed and one of the lucky ones to fight off the virus and and okay
0	That obviously took a huge toll on me
0	It 's like an ache
0	I have been doig a lot of reading and was wondering if anyone has any insight on what could be causing these pains
0	I get nervous looking on the Internet and seeing things like HIV causing these pains
0	Could the stress have caused these pains as I have read that can happen
0	I would appreciate any help on this subject if anyone is going through the same thing
0	Idk if I should go to a doctor or maybe this is a common thing
0	I love that life
0	Everyone else keeps an eye on me
0	I became lost not caring for school , smoke and go to clubs
0	It seems all is   up with school especially its like my future
0	Well my body moves before sleeping
0	IN past it used to move like a frog
0	Hand legs finger used to jump automaticaly
0	Other symotons are similar
0	This disease is so dangrous indeed it so much consfuses that patient feels so well
0	I am still scaring , How to plaster the sky indeed
0	Medicine is just an umbrella
0	Sometime i feel bore why doctor make pendelium
0	Such an expensive medicine
0	I do nt trust mental medicine makes diabities ,
0	Who have already diabities do nt needed to make
0	Take one umbrella and live how long you can live
0	I am thinking waste of time
0	He is to be exicted when doctor used to decrease medicine , A new hope comes new enourage comes , and after some period doctor says or gives new medicines
0	Or one medicine increase another decrease
0	But bottom line depending on something
0	Lucky you if u can buy an umbrella
0	Well taking about paroniod it happens to all
0	That is how it cures
0	Ifnot all should be paroniod
0	I love paroniod
0	I used to work outisde the city
0	I was mentally free
0	physically hard
0	But that is the most enjoyed life in abroad
0	when i used to come to city paroniod used to come
0	then shifted to city
0	same like somebody watching us , or mind sharing , or all same thoughts
0	At first it was so much hard communication with technology
0	Subjects comes nonstop , loop happens , repeats , forgets , lost concentration , All happens mental ilness never happens so many things ,
0	Then i reduced some medicine
0	So much message used to come , and i started to take higer doze
0	and again low , sometime high sometime love , Well i am not sure wil it really help or not ,
0	Now paranoid is not a problem body moves
0	Why I am not sure
0	Sometimes could go out of control little risky
0	At the beginning it was very hard
0	But i didnot find this outside where there is less people
0	city a happens because of noise
0	but this time the strength of the wave is little low
0	and movents is not voilent
0	When the wave is too high it make dangerous communication
0	suppsoe if i think one thing it multiplies too many times , when the wave is low it multiplies the thought less times , thus this type paranoid is ok and easy
0	and hard to sleep
0	but this wave strength is little less thus the weight over my head is also less
0	that is ok to sleep
0	next when wave strenght is high on head if i smile it make smile for long time if felt sad makes too much sad , if felt angry makes too much voilent angry and agressive , but when strength is low , angry also little angry ,
0	i think wave is enhancer
0	Well this is experience , good bad no idea ,
0	BUt if take mediicne all is well , so expensive
0	If take medicine the wave or head heavy wo nt happens
0	It is so much f Every time when medicine reduces sometimes colleges misses job misses , concentration misses
0	sleepy happens , psyco happens , commiunication happens , body psyco happens ,
0	Today body moves why no idea
0	Hi
0	First , I would like to introduce myself
0	Hello folks
0	  So
0	I have problems with nervousness , fear , and paranoia
0	This pain is strong in the eyes , but moreso in my cheekbones
0	Accompanied by this soreness , one or both cheekbones the right always , the left sometimes develop a line that almost looks like a wrinkle , that slashes through the very middle of my cheekbone
0	No
0	I have large cheekbones so this is pretty low
0	They are not red , swollen , dark , or anything
0	I have not gone to the doctor about it
0	I have graying hairs
0	Any input on pains in the face , eyes , bones from stress , what it is and what it is causing to me , etc
0	would greatly be appreciated
0	Fear of loneliness and a commitment to be honorable see the sick in bad days , are at both ends and middle road is hard to find
0	Calling bad cops are a waste of time and he is still really sick
0	Is there any advice to manage his care from a far
0	He refuses to go to counseling and the hospital never has an appointment
0	Is there any advice
0	It seems there is no cure
0	And he has PTSD from the war
0	This email is probably a waste of time because there are no quick fixes and that 's really what people need
0	Tired
0	She is an alcoholic and drug abuser
0	One was for me and one was for couples therapy
0	No wonder I 'm so messed up
0	I 'm a spineless wonder
0	Please D
0	I love that life
0	Everyone else keeps an eye on me
0	I became lost not caring for school , smoke and go to clubs
0	It seems all is   up with school especially its like my future
0	We continued to see each other , having sex etc
0	It was odd
0	NEVER
0	I feel stupid even sending that email
0	We were not just bf and gf , but best friends too
0	How can I help with the pain and unforgivingness of myself
0	So it was so long , thank you
0	I started worrying
0	I had a Fecal Occult Blood test done , which came back negative
0	I did parasite testing , also negative
0	It eventually went away
0	With the stomach problems came severe nausea in the mornings , and nausea after going to the washroom
0	That eventually subsided once my new symptoms kicked in
0	My fears changed from colon cancer to lymphoma
0	I started getting neck pain , jaw pain , and headaches
0	My eyes also got blurry , with some slight eye pain
0	Then my muscles started to twitch
0	Arms , Legs , Feet , Abdomen , Hands , Eye , etc
0	Then I had a bout of weakness
0	Everything was normal , including my glucose , thyroid , calcium , and all others that are typically tested
0	The muscle twitching is still present , however it is not as bad as it used to be
0	it still happens once in a while , but not in the constant way that it was happening when it first started
0	Oh , and my vision has gotten a bit blurry again
0	Does this sound like MS
0	I have also had a normal head CT

0	Its also accompanied by feeling very sad , like I 've failed
0	And that I do n't have enough energy to talk in a more excited or interesting way
0	I just always come off as being awkward and boring
0	This really really upsets me
0	I hate that
0	I began to eat very healthy and workout 3 times a week trying to get some more energy
0	I tied making myself happier by being very positive about things and trying to feel better about life but this did n't help
0	Sometimes ill try drinking energy drinkscoffee and this helps sometimes but is obviously a temporary solution

0	I honestly have no idea what to do
0	I was thinking about calling a helpline for teenagers
0	I have been on effexor xr , 300 mg a day for approx
0	13yrs
0	During that time I went off a couple times , about 5 and 6yrs ago
0	and wondered if anyone knows
0	I have no motivation or desire to do anything , and have no goals for the future
0	Thanks for listening , aandjsmom
0	I was thinking maybe a really mild one
0	ugh
0	If there is someone who has figured out a system or anything besides drugs please help
0	Please do n't read and run
0	God bless everyone suffering its taken a lot for me to realize this is not what life is meant to be
0	I am now engaged and fear that this will ruin things eventually
0	Hello
0	So I 've been testing for cyclical cushings for a while and Dr says its not likely
0	Any ideassuggestions
0	I decided to go back to school for teacher certification as a means of buying time while this charge is being settled
0	Yes I have a lawyer
0	It literally takes every ounce of energy I have at this point to get out of bed
0	Every second of every day I 'm fighting the tears   pain back
0	I feel disconnected from everyone   everything
0	I hate being back in school
0	I contemplate suicide almost everyday
0	I feel like a complete failure in life
0	I 'd give anything just to be able to sleep soundly for 8 hrs solid
0	Sorry if this seems scattered , but just typing what came to mind
0	I am wondering if the heavy marijuana use is the cause of the depression or if it has anything to do with the start of puberty since it runs in the family
0	The depression came after the start of my chronic marijuana use
0	She is hilarious , gorgeous , smart , and fun but struggles constantly with relationships , employment , and most recently the law
0	the ones that inevitably cause her more pain and suffering
0	She has a degree but is going back to school
0	We had a little trip planned before this came about
0	It may be time to be selfish in the interest of self preservation
0	Any perspectives
0	Hello everybodyI made a similar post related to mathSince there on medhelp are dozens of friendly users who tell true informations about diseasessexual things etc
0	There were no visits until March 2007
0	But the thing is that it will last for many hours , and to some extent it may last till the next day
0	And this state of constant concern is what brings on my social paranoia , or anxiety
0	It happens kinda frequently
0	Does anyone else experience this or know what it sounds like
0	I basically get skeched out and begin a process of trying to relax
0	It comes and goes
0	Finally , I am often concerned about things , and can not handle criticism
0	I am trying to get better , but need help understanding how severe it is
0	i would really appreciate it
0	
0	I 'm very confused about it
0	Apart from sexual abuse , what else causes BPD
0	These seem like pretty insignificant things to cause such a debilitating problem
0	Could the fact that I have bp structure rather than bp disorder be why the cause is a bit milder than full on abuse
0	What is the difference between borderline personality structure and borderline personality disorder
0	Another doctor told me the difference is negligible
0	Please help
0	A biopsy of the bladder tissue was done in a bid to confirm or refute the diagnosis
0	The result of the biopsy was negative however , every time the FISH urine test was repeated , it showed cancer cells associated with the bladder
0	I asked for treatment , but was told that BECAUSE the location of the cancer was not established , treatment could not be offered
0	Each cystoscopy showed a ‘ healthy’ bladder with a diverticulum , and hardening wall lining
0	As it did in 2007 , the FISH test in 2014 showed cancer cells of the bladder
0	This time a confirmation test cytology was done and the cancer was confirmed
0	In June 2015 , more biopsies of different parts of the bladder were done
0	I need help
0	
0	This is not a question I need answered
0	After reading these , I feel compelled to share
0	I was so emotional , lost , defeted , angry , and alone
0	It saved my life

0	I feel disgusting and ashamed with myself
0	Thank you for any supportguidance

0	How do you tell the difference

0	He suffered slightly from depression occasionally prior to the accident , but otherwise normal
0	and I 'm a disgrace for getting MS
0	She must think ya catch MS at the local damn grocery store or something

0	It has gotten much better over the past few months
0	What are the chances that this is not lung cancer

0	I am now a somatic psychologist
0	I had major suicidal issues with several attempts coming very close to succeeding a couple of times
0	They have not improved as an adult
0	i remain fairly calm and supportive or remove myself from the situation as needed
0	He is a typical pain in the   teenager but pretty balanced
0	My daughter had many of the same opportunities but quit everything or got in trouble for fighting
0	She has been arrested , been to jail
0	Her choices for friends are mostly from underprivileged and unsavory backgrounds
0	She likes to save people
0	13 and 3
0	Trying to figure out how to reach positive outcomes
0	Any advise appreciated
0	I have struggled with certain emotions , thoughts and feelings for a long time
0	Sometimes I selfmutilate by cutting or slapping myself
0	I feel extremely empty during these times
0	One impulsive behaviour that I have n't been able to eliminate is eating binges and dieting
0	I frequently diet , lose weight and then go on extreme eating binges
0	I have also recently developed a habit of impulsive spending
0	Anyways , I 'm not trying to get a diagnosis here
0	1 He has major temper tantrums about dumb things all the time
0	2 He is very moody with extreme mood swings
0	Sometimes he 's in a good mood and everything is all good
0	5 He is just a very irrational person in generall , and especially so with certain things
0	6 He can be very childesh and immature at times
0	Not by myself might i add just to clear things up a bit
0	He is now and has been having issues in school when it come to the teachers , listening , following directions and getting along with the other children
0	But I do n't believe that is the case
0	I 've recently been diagnosed with fatty liver disease and hemangioma
0	I 'm on a strict healthy diet with absolutely no alcohol , no soda , no sugar , etc
0	I ca n't stop taking xanax because of panic attacks
0	I really like lamictal
0	I feel normal on it
0	At one time I increased it to 250 mg but decided to go back to 200 mg , which has worked great
0	I 'm going to start lowering it soon , first to 150 mg and hopefully can go completely medfree
0	If it does nt work out , then maybe I can at least just stay on 100 mg
0	BUT at the time I was drinking very , very heavy and was in a bad abusive relationship
0	I 'm single and FINE with being single
0	I 'm going to start therapy again soon
0	I have to take pain pills right now
0	I 've just been laying around in bed
0	So
0	I just wanted to know if anyone has had any luck being off their medication for a long period of time
0	If so , do you go to therapy
0	DBT therapy , group and individual
0	Do you take vitamins , suppliments , herbs
0	Yoga
0	Alternative medicine and treatment
0	Acupuncture
0	I 'm not overweight
0	I did drink heavy , but have completely stopped and will never drink again
0	Facing the consequences now
0	Depression and suicidal ideation has always been a problem
0	Been married 9 years   together on and off 19 years   for the past 5 years things have not been good
0	half of the time
0	And where was hubby when I needed just a little support
0	You probably know the answer to that
0	So why am I feeling so depressed
0	Thanks for listening
0	I find the dream very upsetting and regularly wake up crying
0	Its so easy to have a go at yourself telling yourself to ' snap out of it ' , but how do you snap out of it
0	Thanks so much
0	These symptoms are there EVERY DAY , they never go away
0	I have not lost the ability to taste but eatingdrinkingsmoking does , most times , aggravate the symptoms
0	I also have had several episodes of just the pinky tips going numb
0	I have had full blood work up and with the exception of a low carbon dioxide , all else was normal
0	I also had a negative MRI and the films were reviewed by 2 neurologists
0	I had a full dental exam and tissue and gums are all healthy
0	I also had a full gynecological workup that was normal
0	The rozerem does not help at all with the sleep
0	My primary and the 2 neurologists really do n't have a clue what is going on
0	I am ready for a mouth transplant
0	Has anyone had any of these symptoms together and were you diagnosed andor has it gone away
0	How long did it last
0	I do n't know what else to do
0	Thanking you all in advance

0	Hello
0	Sooo many questions soooo little answers
0	Lexapro has been the only effective medication however it does not help enough nor does it prove to be more effective increasing the dosage
0	After experiencing repetitive emotional traumas starting at age 13 the depression and anxiety intensified each year
0	When i switched schools at 16 for a better education things went haywire
0	I am not finding the energy to do what needs done
0	Due to the particular emotional trauma i have a difficult time expressing anger or getting angry as a motivator
0	I do the opposite and breakdown instead
0	I am unhappy 100 of the time
0	Any recommendations would be great , even the unusual ones of course
0	The bed is big enough for 2 people but barely , smaller than a queen
0	Does n't that just seem odd

0	The first one that I had never hurt was just in the way

0	It 's palpable with light pressure
0	It is n't soft nor does it feel like a rock beneath the skin
0	It is definitely firm
0	It 's hard to tell if it 's movable or not
0	I am very worried this could be lymphoma
0	About 3 days ago it was quite inflamed but that has gone down considerably
0	My throat is still a little scratchy , though
0	How long should I wait to go to the doctor for this node
0	How fast does lymphoma grow
0	I have checked but found no other enlarged nodes
0	This change in the economy
0	Everyone hates this man , for a reason
0	So I look and wait everyday
0	OK
0	Do nt see much to look forward to anymore
0	I hate living this way
0	I want to enjoy life again , but do nt know how anymore
0	Valarian root helps for sleep a little bit
0	I know many are now in this situation
0	I do nt want prescriptions
0	I appreciate any ideas , as doing nothing has the same results
0	I applied for SSDI and got it first time around
0	No need to appeal or anything
0	I had a wonderful childhood
0	We had a nice house , family vacations
0	Definitely no abuse at all in any way
0	But I 'm still struggling
0	My temper flares bad
0	The littlest thing sets me off

0	My wife is Korean
0	Some of it may be seen as just cultural or language differences , but clearly there is something far more significant going on
0	  She gets very very angry , usually over almost nothing
0	  a little sensitive to noise and sound   can not multitask very well   has a very poor memory for events , but decent for phone numbers etc
0	  prior to meeting me was very promiscuous with numerous one night stands
0	  Has a few friends , but no one close
0	I simply do n't know what to do
0	Any help or advice would be strongly appreciated
0	It is probably about the size of a pea , maybe smaller , and very mobile , squishy , and painless
0	Am I making a mountain out of a molehill
0	I 'm 24
0	Hey everyone , I have a question
0	The one by his jaw was huge and was visible without even touching it
0	About the size of a small egg
0	They did an ultrasound of it but never did anything else
0	Blood work ruled out Mono , Cat Scratch Fever , and various other things
0	He does n't tend to be the wrestling around type
0	Regardless , she told us to watch it , it would probably go away on its own
0	The bump is still there
0	You can visibly see the bump and it appears to be non moveable and not rock hard but firmer than squishy if that makes sense
0	We had an ultrasound done and it showed absolutely nothing out of the ordinary
0	We have a MRI scheduled
0	Is there a reason a ultrasound would not pick this up
0	Is a MRI all I should ask for
0	Should I ask for a biopsy especially if it comes back normal
0	Are MRI 's better at picking up things then ultrasound
0	I have very strong , violent fantasies accompanied by violent paraphilias such as sadomasochism strong attractions to blood , murder , rape , etc
0	  and attractions to convicts or people who commit violent crimes
0	I am also a female
0	I find myself exploring masochism and watching violent forms of pornography
0	it was n't even a break up
0	He went to jail and a restraining order was put in effect immediately
0	I lost the baby
0	i am in a cold sweat and hyper ventilating
0	am i going to be alone forever
0	what is wrong with me
0	any advice is welcomed
0	I have to be the one that always starts the conversation

0	I just found this forum
0	My legs were never great ie cellulite but the skin fit
0	I googled and attributed it to stress
0	But then a few things happened at once
0	I lost weightin total about 35 pounds
0	At 125 pounds , my skin still fit
0	My arms , while not looking toned , still looked smooth
0	Then I lost another 10 , down to about 115
0	I quickly went through menopause
0	Yes , all this occurred at the same time
0	At first I attributed it to the weight loss
0	I tried to bulk up with protein to no avail
0	THEN , again , seemingly overnight , my arms got HORRIBLE
0	The backs triceps began to hang off like a 300 pound womans
0	The skin over my inner elbow crease started to hang over and got crepey
0	In fact I have many times
0	Finally , my muscle strength disappeared
0	And even that I can barely lift
0	Now I look older
0	I am obsessed with this
0	I can not imagine going to the beach or a pool ever again
0	Yes , I was a sun worshipper as a kid , but this literally happened overnight
0	and have tried tightening creams
0	Have n't yet done retin A all over as it 's pricey
0	Someone mentioned Glycolic 35 peels
0	Not sure if you can get that yourself or need a doctor
0	I did start to research Thermage and Ultherapy
0	It SEEMS like Ultherapy is new and for the faceneck
0	The closest I 've come is one doctor who did it once on the arms
0	I 've even tried calling the company but ca n't get a person on the phone
0	Plus , it 's SO EXPENSIVE and I 'm worried that it wo n't work
0	And I do n't want to go somewhere that has only done it once and really has no results to speak of
0	One doctor mentioned a fractional laser but it did n't sound like it works that well and it would take many sessions
0	I 'm just now reading about this rolling thing and the dry loufah
0	That sounds painful but what the heckI'll try that
0	Does Retin A really help this
0	Has anyone done Thermage
0	I ca n't imagine spending that much and seeing no results
0	It is really traumatizing
0	It sounds insane , but I ca n't stop thinking about it
0	Any other suggestions are appreciated as well
0	custody
0	he did nt try anything else till february

0	I am still in total shock
0	Pls help
0	Hello to everyone on this forum
0	I had posted here before but never got any response
0	I would greatly appreciate any input on this matter
0	The report said the following Increase in thickness of endometrium persists with inhomogeneous texture
0	The appearances may be due to endometrial hyperplasia but because of the progression of the inhomogeneous texture one should consider the possibility of endometrial malignancy
0	Left ovary is normal , right is normal in size with poorly defined hypoechoic area
0	It may represent a resolving fillicle
0	A nabothian cyst is present on cervix
0	Inhomogeneous texture of endometrium
0	Free pelvic fluid observed do n't remember the measurements
0	Did anyone here have anything like that
0	Does thickness of endometrium of 22 cm indicate cancer
0	I would be really thankful if anybody could leave comments
0	Thank you beforehand

0	It lasted a few minutes and then disappeared just on its own
0	I am also a very stressed out person and am very anxious and worried all the time
0	My doctor did say just as a guess well maybe the rash is fromnerves
0	Does anyone know what this sudden red blotchy rash could be fromI would love to know if anyone has any ideas or suggestions
0	And also can stress and anxiety cause these kind of rashes
0	Have any of you ever gotten these rashes from stress
0	Or do you think the rashes are caused by something elseand if so what could it be from
0	Hi ppl
0	life can get   and unfair
0	
0	I was breastfeeding exclusively , and had to stop because of the surgery
0	Then there 's the story with my babys daddy
0	He wants all the glam of having a baby without the nitty gritty
0	Its more than any court would give him to say the least
0	Because once I do , the fights will really start
0	I 'm so stressed out , exhausted from caring for a newborn , and still trying to heal from giving birth , then having major surgery
0	Physically or mentally , I just ca n't
0	Then I hate myself even more for thinking that
0	I just do n't know how to not feel this way
0	Does this sound like ppd
0	
0	why stay
0	Is this a joke
0	Life ischaotic , depressive , and lonely
0	I make it what it is
0	I should have already left
0	And it crossed my mind where is home
0	where do I belong
0	I had been put in the wrong body with the wrong parents , siblings , planet even
0	I long to be there and to be whole again
0	Hi , This is maybe more of a question regarding stress andor shame
0	I 've made some huge mistakes but does n't everbody
0	Can anybody give me any advice
0	I keep wondering how people who cheat on stag do 's and hen parties deal with this
0	Cheers
0	i 'm freaked out
0	help anyone
0	
0	not to me
0	what are the problems in an adults caused by emotional unavailability of family
0	My partner is a minstors son
0	I was just a girl who did nt want change , but dd to early
0	Everything was going downhill
0	Help me out
0	
0	I do not know what to do
0	i really need to get help
0	this man knows about it from long time but he does not like it
0	in order to get some release i am doing that
0	i am so happy at work and having fun at work
0	But lately we have been talking about getting back together
0	he was sitting there on the couch with some girl
0	so of course i freaked out
0	i m soo confused
0	what should i do
0	What should i do
0	I 'm a happy , optomistic , funny person
0	Except for my health
0	would I end up with huge scars or not
0	was pretty much the scariest thing in the world
0	But then , I suddenly came dowm with a viral gastritis
0	A blood test showed my iron and ferrtin levels were low
0	But as time past , I just kept getting more and more tired
0	I 'd run out of breath just going up a flight of stairs
0	I would fall from weaness sometimes
0	It 's been two months with no improvements
0	So what 's my doctor 's diagnosis
0	Depression
0	I just ca n't agree with that
0	But I just do n't believe that s what 's going on here
0	but I physically can not keep up
0	It makes no sense
0	I do n't feel anxious
0	This does not feel at ALL like depression
0	Can my doctor be right
0	Can I be happy but depressed and not know it
0	Or are they missing something medically
0	Lately I ’ve been having thoughts
0	I just want to get out of this zone
0	I want to go away
0	It ’s just that it ’s too hard
0	I want to just leave
0	Get away from this pain
0	I hate this feeling so much
0	I ’m just that girl that is n’t very smart
0	Is n’t getting good grades
0	And probably is n’t going to go to a good college
0	I want to live in the present but it ’s just too hard
0	The pressures of the future are just scary
0	I want to hide
0	Get away from this world for a while then return back like nothing ever happened
0	But that ’ll never happen
0	Because my life is already ruined , for the future at least
0	Why
0	Everything is just so hard
0	I want to leave
0	Get away
0	Move on
0	I do n’t want to tell a professional
0	I ’ll get sent away
0	Be put into a hospital
0	but that wo n’t help
0	It wo n’t make me a sudden genius
0	It just wo n’t
0	I ca n’t say goodbye world
0	It ’s just to hard
0	and go on with my life
0	Because I just have to
0	I ’d be letting down on too much too many people and things
0	I 've felt just in despair for quite a while
0	Just on and off
0	Since Middle School
0	And I 'm in High School now
0	The lump was the size of a plum
0	It got to the point where I became seriously concerned about it
0	I underwent surgery and had the tumor removed immediatly
0	But I am being blamed for it
0	I do n't understand
0	I do n't understand
0	Its not like we had a perfect marraige and everything was roses
0	This created a pretty large rift in our relationship and problems grew more menacing
0	Things came to a head when we briefly split up but had a oneoff hook up which ended with us both fighting again
0	I 'm almost afraid to let anyone in that close again
0	My current girlfriend definitely notices
0	haha
0	Hi
0	I also got depressed again
0	I have been trying a lot of medicines and therapies
0	It 's like every thought brings me sensations , memories , images , etc
0	I ca n't make choices
0	I 'm really lost
0	I feel anger with no reason , and am afraid of being an evil person
0	I am also afraid that everyone may be lying
0	I 'm going to make this as brief and to the point as possibe
0	I was diagnosed with depersonalization disorder
0	That I did n't need to eat , talk , do anything , really
0	But there 's more
0	I watched tv with a blank face and started repeating what the actors were saying out loud , trying to imitate emotion
0	I know a guy know who has no emotion
0	Unable to smile , talk , but only for short periods of time
0	And I heard that rehersing conversations is a symtom too
0	And ilately I 've been getting worse
0	Mild hallucinations , such as hearing faint breathing from no where
0	Seeing auras , but they stay eveb when the person is gone
0	Any opinions
0	He has a severe drinking problem and has no willingness to better himself
0	losing battle , so I said ok only a six pack
0	But no that 's not good enough , Now it 's 2 six packs and whiskey
0	Now that is n't good enough either , now it 's everyday
0	One beer is not the problem , it 's the 512 beers after that
0	Where do I start
0	Let 's say his name is Cory
0	Anyways , Cory and I really hit it off
0	It was total bliss
0	Now , this decision was n't entirely based on him
0	I moved in with the friend that introduced us
0	But having him around was definitely a bonus
0	I was n't thinking about the future
0	I was n't thinking about the future at all
0	So we broke up
0	And that 's where the problem is
0	We are still around each other all of the time
0	That 's where the problem is
0	We sleep together , and things are okay
0	We get along fine
0	Then there is something that just makes me insanely crazy and jealous
0	A text from someone , a call
0	Then we sleep together again
0	This has been the cycle for 4 months
0	But I 'm doing it for the comfort
0	But does he really
0	Anyways , that just needed to be off of my chest
0	I live an hour and a half away
0	I am devastated but relieved
0	We have all of the same friends so full avoidance is impossible
0	But not talking to him online , on the phone
0	It 's not good for me
0	Any takers
0	Thank you for listening
0	Hi guys
0	And I did n't have suicidal inclinations anymore
0	I decided to change to Sertraline
0	Now , I want good results back , as soon as possible
0	What should I do , continue Sertraline or changing back to Fluoxetine
0	Does Fluoxetine kick in quickly this time
0	I have always had a low blood pressure , so this extra drop was annoying
0	I feared that 40 mg Fluoxetine may make it worse
0	Thus , Sertraline which has some small Dopamine reuptake inhibition effect may be a better choice
0	But they do n't
0	There 's no family support
0	People who used to be friends are n't anymore
0	Nobody cares and I just feel so sad
0	He has always been possesive , but now it 's to the point of ridiculous
0	Of course he did n't answer the phone
0	I 'm sorry this is so long
0	Got carried away venting
0	Thanks for reading
0	Thankfully they got there in time and was thumping on the door
0	With the banging from the officers still going on in the background she finally opened the door
0	Thanks for listening everyone
0	So needless to say i m still a single mommy
0	any advise on that
0	I just need some advise good or bad
0	Thanks
0	
0	My last relationship was a disaster
0	He wanted to be with us bothhe would nt take a no for an answer
0	Well I should start off with some basic background information
0	Recently my mother and stepfather have decided to get a divorce
0	My mother at the time was having an affair with another man
0	This is where my question comes in
0	From 800 am to about 1000 pm we were locked outside with out food or anything
0	They are well respected by friends , coworkers , and family
0	So no one believes me
0	I do n't know who to go to
0	Or are we stuck taking all of the threats and verbal abuse making us feel like dirt
0	day
0	This dilemma has torn our family
0	My question is , are these symptoms of schizophrenia
0	Stuff happened
0	Which is the main reason of them going to court and getting a divorce
0	But recently , he died from liver failure
0	That along with I constantly think about suicide
0	I 'm alone about 80 percent of the time
0	Left alone with my thoughts
0	I tried suicide a few times from overdose on pain killers
0	But yet , I just got really sick , and had to lie and say it was a stomach flu
0	I only have a few close friends
0	I recently lost a few
0	I left with 3
0	One of them lives in another state , which is n't much help
0	Way to go , mom
0	That s when my cutting got bad
0	Its disgusting
0	But am I depressed
0	I just need help
0	Cutting does n't even hurt anymore
0	Honestly , I 'm not afraid to die
0	Please , can I get some help
0	Thanks
0	We are both virgins and do not engage in sexual intercourse
0	This time , too we were careful
0	My finger FELT dry too , just very slightly sticky
0	There was certainly no wetness anywhere
0	Could there have been pre on my fingers
0	Am I being paranoid , or is there any chance of pregnancy
0	Thanks very much for reading
0	Hello to all and thanks for taking the time to read this
0	I have not been able to face and begin dealing with this directly until now
0	I have been living in denial for a long time
0	What happens remains hidden from view , and has been happening since before we became intimately involved
0	I am a 47yearold man who is married to a 45yearold woman
0	We continue to live together
0	In other words , there is no acknowledgement that anything was said by me
0	It seems to be triggered by something I ca n't identify
0	I can be very cutting , and this is exactly what happens
0	This will continue until one of us leaves the presence of the other and the cycle seems to end , or at least pauses
0	We both go away feeling incredibly hurt and emotionally abandoned by the other person
0	These ‘ apologies’ quite frequently result in another screaming match
0	I feel that it ’s very possible there may be other things at work here and this may only be the beginning
0	In addition to this , it ’s imperative that I get anger management help , and quickly
0	All comments are appreciated
0	Thank you again for reading this
0	Sincerely , A Very Troubled Person
0	Quit smoking January 2014 and on ECig now

0	It is a struggle just to get up in the morning
0	Thank you
0	what s worse is that I 'm used to it
0	And now i do nt even feel so bad anymore because its so routine
0	It 's been a year
0	I feel alone
0	All the time
0	So alone that I had to resort to writing on this blog
0	I also have no confidence or selfasteem whatsoever and am painfully shy
0	i feel ugly and weird and misunderstood

0	It has been horrible
0	I have gained weight
0	The brain fog disappeared , I do n't feel crazy
0	Does anyone have any suggestions that would help with my plight
0	There is a swollen piece of meat hanging inside the back of the right side of my mouth
0	I noticed it was because there was pain in that area
0	The pain feels like an ulcer
0	If it was just a regular ulcer I would've ignored it
0	What worries me this time is because of the physical state it 's in
0	I do n't know if it 's swollen or not , but it 's popping out
0	Here are some photos

0	i needed help , not degradation
0	but in doing so , i have screwed myself as a mother
0	what else can i do
0	i hope this is sufficient explanation , its probably a little wacky
0	there is so much that has happened , its hard to pinpoint the most important aspects without it becoming a novel
0	His emotions are very yoyo and temper is explosive at the drop of a hat
0	I feel like screaming all the time and visualize killing people alot
0	I was marrieddivorced at 19
0	1
0	Broke my heart
0	I have a huge ball gown
0	Ugh
0	2
0	3
0	He does n't work much , just enough to get by , and does n't think that work should be a way of life but rather a way to live
0	4
0	Regardless of my feelings
0	5
0	He always talks a lot about other women 's boobs and
0	Mostly he is joking
0	Is this normal
0	Can I please have some thoughts
0	Thanks
0	no but it ai nt
0	Thanks
0	so am a 15 year old
0	it still does
0	this being said , does anyone know what i could do
0	am afraid that its gunna get worst
0	i do nt wanna go there
0	Anyway , it got so bad that I did n't want to leave the house , crying a lot for no reason , tired a lot , not eating very much , ect
0	That seriously helped me out so much
0	I do n't think
0	Is it just because my body is still getting use to the 150 mg
0	or is the Effexor not working anymore
0	As for me , idk
0	I do n't know if all the stress is effecting everything
0	Is there anything I can do
0	Any ideasadvice would be great
0	Thanks
0	Hey there
0	Most of the time during the attack I 'm tenseflush at times and somewhat anxious
0	Then I have to breathe through it amd wait for it to pass
0	Any ideas
0	Is this just my wacky nervous system
0	During this time another man got on the train and started talking loudly down his phone
0	It looked like a cheap phone
0	At the same time I behave perfectly normal around people , if not a little over the top
0	I laugh or giggle inapropriately at random times
0	Once I saw a woman die in hospital and had to keep myslelf from laughing
0	The main difference is the length of the depressive or manic moods , right
0	And the fact that Borderline might diminish with time or actually be cured , is that true
0	Could I have borderline
0	A few changes at work and I and many others are not happy
0	I feel quite anxious and may need support
0	Always tired
0	Have OCD
0	Would be very ' off ' in the morning and get better during the day patient best friends
0	Did nt speak to most other class mates except ones in my group
0	Was either depressed or sometimes very hyper and happy for silly small reasons
0	I 've changed now and try to always smile and chat to others
0	Still , I 'm quite jealous and envious about people and have bad will white pretending to be good
0	I bear grudges long
0	I am quite fake
0	I am ashamed of this but ca nt stop
0	Ca nt stop saying negative things , i 've tried a few times
0	Why am i such a crappy person
0	what is wrong with me
0	I ca n't seem to fix it
0	even slowly
0	No smiling , etc
0	Any ideas
0	Can I apply for stress leave
0	In the beginning it was great , a typical falling in love scenario
0	I was wanting to explore with other women but never did cheat
0	We were also happy that the older one will have a sibling
0	I do n't care about that stuff anymore
0	Happy one day miserable the next
0	Tired of pretending but so confused and lost
0	I just want the opinions of couples with experience
0	hello there
0	this is not me speaking a chiche
0	well i simply do nt have one
0	but hw ront listen
0	its was not his fault
0	My hypochondira is not all health related
0	How do you guys get through this
0	I can barely handle it
0	My mother will NEVER do that
0	God
0	And lately I have become VERY suicidal
0	I honestly have no idea what to do
0	I was thinking about calling a helpline for teenagers
0	Even after lapse of so much time my son complains different problems like pain in back side of scrotal area , closed nose and dizziness , giddiness with body pains
0	He was shown to several doctors so far
0	No body has indicated any major problems
0	He has got a cyst also in scrotal but it is not major
0	What could be the reason for these symptoms
0	What are the tests he requires to undergo
0	Her urine test was showing presence of puss cells 2 to 4
0	His scrotal scan shows mild vericocele and prostate enlargement to little extent
0	Which was not given importance by the doctor
0	Lately it feels severe and at times too much to take on and I begin to feel l ca n't handle it anymore
0	It 's my everyday routine
0	What I would greatly appreciate and desperately need right now is advice from others who have been through this or are currently battling this
0	What do you do to helpget through it
0	Or , what DID you do to overcome it
0	I 'm at a loss
0	Please help
0	Panic attacks , derealization at times and generalized anxiety
0	It kind of feels like I 'm dreaming , or tripping on a low dose of shrooms or something
0	I quit smoking marijuana because of these anxiety issues
0	I 'm winning the fight
0	These feelings do not appear with panic attacks or anxiety and that s what scares me
0	I 'll just be sitting there , watching a movie , and then BANG
0	My heart is skipping beats and such
0	Could stress be causing this
0	NO
0	I honestly do n't know what to do anymore
0	Its not even a confidence problem because I know the difference between ugly and pretty
0	I am anxious all of the time
0	It was far far too soon but I went along with it , in retrospect , as a distraction
0	Very quickly it became apparent that my new boyfriend was very controlling , manipulative and at times cruel
0	Yet , years later I have never found a way
0	However , as is so often the case with this sort of man , he can also be wonderful
0	He has lost a lot of weight very quickly , has strange symptoms and has a lump in this throat
0	We ended up sleeping together
0	What should I do
0	I am absolutely positive it did n't go in
0	Is there a chance i could get pregnant
0	Is it a high possibility
0	He says that popular kids are stupid
0	When he does hang out with friends it 's always the same younger video gamer friend
0	He shows no intrest in being a part of anything
0	He does n't want to be a part of anything
0	When it comes I can foresee a major arguement
0	Its one thing to have the public have a bad attitude to mental illness , but when your family also does , it makes life so much harder
0	Thanks for letting me vent
0	He 's a completely different person
0	I have anxiety and depression
0	Hello Doc Fernando
0	1 In my Chest PA xray remarks says that Suspicious densities are seen in the left upper lung field
0	Spot view with winged out scapula is suggested
0	2 then last May 3 , 2011
0	I undergo again for Spot view and the results says Ancillary study shows nodulohazy in the left upper lobe , likely tuberculous in etiology
0	I do n't know what to do
0	I feel very disconnected from myself
0	I do n't know what to do
0	It 's making me feel crazy
0	I 'm numb
0	What 's going on
0	It 's bothering me so much
0	
0	That 's his way of understanding
0	Seriously
0	Depression   I get depressed very easily and it comes and goes and starts very suddenly
0	I just feel dazed and vacant most of the time when this happens
0	Dreams   I have had lots and lots of weird dreams lately
0	This caused a small debate and this person became quite disapproving of me seeing this nutritionist
0	I also felt torn between divided opinions
0	In a way I 've started to not care anymore
0	I can get angry to happy to sad and back to angry at the drop of a hat
0	I was picked on at school for being ugly and unpopular
0	
0	And by clean I mean not being destuctive to myself
0	And by not being destructive to myself , I mean not looking at pornography and masterbating to it
0	stuff like that
0	Period
0	I do
0	I do nt know
0	But I ca nt help it
0	I love women
0	Its just weird
0	But that one fear always hits me
0	That one about my fiance
0	What do you think
0	I have done well on the HIV meeds with minimal side affect
0	I try very hard to do so
0	That is really hard for me to accept
0	Please if there is anyone out there that can relate to the drag of taking meds , living with a potentially deadly decease , and the difficulty of dealing with memory loss , physical limitations and just plain miserable I would appreciate hearing from ou
0	Anyone believing in praise lease say them
0	I went to police station and gave complaint
0	He just used abused language
0	I had gone from being a pretty successful high school student with perfect grades and lots of good references to a complete drop kick
0	Her house is absolute squalor with old take out boxes stacked up , smelling diapers in the garbage cans , piles of dirty clothes smelling like mold and the floors are full of spilt food and chocolate milk
0	What is going on
0	The alternative means I 'm risking falling into the black pit of despair
0	Wrong
0	Latter part of July it hit like a ton of bricks
0	And for another 3 weeks
0	And to please call back if I have any more questions
0	Am I unfairly judging this situation
0	Is it time for a second opinion , or am I just being a wuss
0	PS
0	The answer was yes , thank goodness
0	Thank God for the people who man those phones   they are wonderful
0	If you need someone to talk to , CALL
0	You can find numerous phone numbers by googling crisis hotline or suicide hotline
0	Try different numbers until somebody picks up
0	I 've been able to reach someone in less than 5   10 minutes max both times
0	Missy
0	Hi there , I am in pre menopause and entering menopause
0	My periods have been irregular for the past while
0	My weight is good and am a non smoker
0	Went for an ultrasound due to cysts that cleared up
0	But the last ultrasound showed a thickened lining
0	So off to the gyn I head for a biopsy that came back with complex hyperplasia No cancer or pre cancer showing
0	I am not knowing what to dois a hystercomy really necessary
0	How common is a thick uterus in a woman that is entering menopause
0	Any advise would be greatly appreciated
0	We continue to have problems
0	The mom is self medicating with alcohol to the extent of 34 beers a night , she is very instable with relationships , blah , blah , blah
0	We do n't know what to do
0	Any suggestions
0	Courses of action
0	after I leaveetc
0	The treatment of Autistic and Mental Patients are generally costly
0	We did n't know anything about that disease
0	Later when we learned enough about it , it was too late
0	The controversy overshadowed the disease
0	It was a rough night and still scares me
0	Now the tremor has somehow started again
0	She wo n't understand
0	She wo n't go
0	i wanna die
0	I ca n't find a way out
0	What do i do
0	
0	I never really questioned it
0	My selfesteem is almost gone
0	Now , it seems that the teenhood experience has resulted in being in an emotionally abusive relationship with a man that I partly resent
0	How long does this withdrawal take
0	Never again will I go on these prescription drugs
0	What is worse , depression or Meds , where is the help in this
0	I have looked into natural ways to help depression , still thinking yes , no
0	The mind is strong and we could teach it to help ourselves through anything
0	I talk a good game right
0	I wish us all well , take care
0	And honestly my tap water is n't the cleanest , ITS NOT GROSS DONT WORRY IT JUST DOESN'T TASTE THAT GREAT
0	It feels like the muscles contract abruptly , but it only lasts a second
0	Sometimes it feels like someone is putting pressure on my lower back
0	It does n't hurt , but it is really frustrating and a little startling
0	It is really starting to stress me out
0	It started happening after a very stressful event that started interfering my sleep
0	It it anxiety related
0	Or is it a lower backleg problem
0	It would take such a load off my mind
0	I just want things to go back to normal
0	My mother have no respect for men
0	All my step fathers fell into the same trap
0	Nevertheless , I ca n't stand women in any position of authority over men
0	The slighest deviation of the traditional female role poses a threat to me
0	This has caused me to wage many useless battles against women
0	I am being radical and irrational
0	I do not want to continue going through life in a never ending power struggle with females
0	This is not how I normally act
0	PleaseI just want to know i m not alone
0	Thanks
0	Panic attacks , derealization at times and generalized anxiety
0	It kind of feels like I 'm dreaming , or tripping on a low dose of shrooms or something
0	I quit smoking marijuana because of these anxiety issues
0	I 'm winning the fight
0	These feelings do not appear with panic attacks or anxiety and that s what scares me
0	I 'll just be sitting there , watching a movie , and then BANG
0	My heart is skipping beats and such
0	Could stress be causing this
0	I also have had about 30 ECTs
0	There was no talking to her
0	I went home and just cried
0	Do n't know what to do now
0	35 year old female , no history of trauma or abuse
0	Symptoms of anxiety and bipolar likely began in childhood , which are currently controlled with meds
0	Do n't know any other way to put that
0	  In the past , antideps nor therapy helped this
0	Am currently on Buspar for anxiety and low dose Trileptal which is a mood stabilizer
0	I now live in another state and while the emotional abuse continues , the physical abuse has stopped
0	I just want to make some steps forward to solving this problem
0	I have also searched for local support groups
0	Does anyone have any advice
0	At that time he went through job after job , and could not hold one
0	It became an impossible relationship
0	Other than the issues that split us up it was like we were made for each other
0	This was his first lie
0	After the girlfriend thing we tried to start dating
0	Moving into maybe having thanksgiving at one or the other 's families house , you see a gradual closeness
0	He could never get comfortable
0	He said that the trash man got it all
0	Its text after text of crap
0	He has made dates and no shown up , never called , picked fights , ect
0	But it always happens again
0	I do not know what to do
0	Any help would be appreciated
0	thanks
0	Mydad on the other hand was a very verbally abusive man and physically abusive to my brother
0	I just wanted to get rid of the pain or whatever
0	I do n't want to die
0	I 'm 17 High school student
0	IM OVER IT
0	I wan't it to end
0	What the hell would this be
0	My father was in the military and often deployed
0	My mother did n't handle this very well
0	I guess teenagers are n't people , though
0	Did she hit hard
0	Well , she CAN'T hit hard , but that is n't exactly the issue
0	I know that
0	THe chronic pain , PTSD and side effects make me someone people do not want to be around
0	I understand that
0	I hate it
0	and it makes me so sad
0	But I understand why
0	But , my mother , that is different
0	It was obvious that the whole idea was for the 2 of us to watch something we could both laugh and smile at together
0	But the part of my brain that is still smart
0	That part knows the truth I think
0	And it was n't even like I just happened to be in that room randomly
0	Dad and I even said that out loud
0	I just do n't understand what the issue is
0	Often I feel like before the accident
0	So when she does things like that , it hurts even more
0	Or even that I am worth staying in the room with
0	That is intentional
0	I am sad
0	But I do not have any idea how to handle this
0	IDK , any suggestions are welcome

0	and trust me it does 95 of the time
0	I 've been into drug use for quite a long time , starting out quite young hopping from one substance to another
0	i ca nt seem to hold a job together , mostly depending on the environment
0	i do n't like working around people or being in public at all
0	even if it was cold outside and i was in a tshirt it would still happen
0	i know it sounds complicated and that s the worst part about it
0	on the edge all the time feeling like i just wanna roll over and diejk
0	wether it be rude or not i understand
0	I have been physically and emotionally abused for a very long time and to some extent sexually too
0	I have felt so renewed
0	I can not stop crying
0	Hi , I have been into a relationship for past 10 yrs
0	I am not married though yet
0	Things were gud so far
0	And time passed by and we had a regular fight over it
0	Now his mother has created a barrier in between us
0	I do nt know what to do now
0	breast cancer , as well as 6 rounds of Herceptin
0	It 's not very painful , but extremely uncomfortable
0	And it is getting worse
0	It is not so bad after just the Herceptin treatments , but it still happens
0	But all tests were negative
0	I am worried that things will just get much worse if nobody can figure out what this is all about
0	So apparently that 's not it either
0	Any ideas
0	Anyone else ever had that problem
0	Please help
0	Okay
0	Thank you
0	I 'm into very ' mellow ' hobbies like golf , snowboarding and video games
0	Snowboarding very much being mellow yet super intense at the same time
0	I was so irritable at so many things for no reason
0	Now , so many years down the road it has only gotten worse with time
0	And I realize this
0	So here we go
0	If anyone thinks that they can help , or has something to say , please post on this
0	Hey hey
0	all coming up real soon
0	It has had the opposite effect as the other SSRIs
0	Will this likely subside as I adjust to the medication
0	If I were to go down to 5mgs would that still be a therapeutic dose
0	Or should I tough out the 10
0	I am kind of a light weight   , plus the idea of being apathetic , foggy headed , and dull witted does n't sit well with school
0	Thanks for any input
0	For a long time i have wanted to die
0	I have no one to turn to or tell
0	Days like these are n't too bad , i just feel really hopeless , worthless and sad
0	Like i 'm screaming but no one can hear
0	It sounds so stupid , like surley that ca n't be going on in someones head
0	And surely someone of that age ca n't feel that way when there are people out there who have it so much worse than me
0	Sorry for bothering you
0	It 's SOOOO BAD
0	I do n't know why this happensespecially the awful waves of depression
0	If that s how bad depression can get I understand suicide
0	The problem is that she is not an easy child to get along with
0	What do I do about this
0	What can I expect moving forward
0	Everything is like that
0	The days seem to run together so perfectly its so weird and hard to explain
0	So it 's the one thing I can control
0	
0	It 's the tinnitus that has been the arrow in my knee and it does n't seem to let up
0	My memory is crap
0	I 'm unsure if this is a symptom of depression or if it 's a symptom of heavy marijuana usage
0	I 'd be interested to know if anybody else has this going on alongside their other symptoms
0	Thank you and please help

0	
0	I do nt know how to stop being depressed and it is getting to a bad level
0	it is not visible , but one can feel by touching itit is very narrow block only 7 cms in width,5 cm in heightbut it was balancing the celing of huge weight
0	MAY BE IN WAS INJURY TO SCALP
0	but can it result in loss of memory or any other concentration problem
0	but alertness had reduced
0	THE BUMP IN SCALP NOW HAS NOT GONE PERFECTLY AND STILL STAYS , my academic performance has reducedcan it be an internal injury
0	these occur rarely
0	WILL THAT MINOR BLOW BE A SHOCK IN BRAIN , OR HEAD INJURY LIKE THAT
0	when does one have head injury only when bleeding from scalp occurs
0	whenever u get a hard blow , will it be affecting ur cognitive ability
0	But wonder if this is an old drug and the move to something more recent may be worth thinking about , discussing with my doctor
0	I suppose a depressing side effect of new patented medications is the cost , which may be so high that along can make one depressed
0	The Sertraline is very affordable
0	the following fights of last year were n't as ugly , but still , compared to daily husband   wife disagreements , this was like world war

0	Thanks fpr any help
0	What type of behavior is this
0	  It 's my mother 's birthday , a room of 15 people bring out a cake and proceed to sing happy birthday
0	I skiied down a hill and fell at the bottom
0	I got up laughing hysterically at myself
0	Now she is claiming brain damage from the incident
0	Growing up , she would claim to be too broke for anything school or sport related , but would take us out to VERY expensive meals the same night
0	Is something seriously wrong with my mother
0	Hi
0	My mom is 69
0	Extreme pain in ribs , stomach , sometimes more in upper right quadrant , back , shoulders
0	Dr seemed to be leaning towards stomach malignancy yesterday , but no definitive answers yet
0	However , the paracentesis was n't able to remove much fluid at allthick and urine colored
0	Did n't know if that would have shown up in CT scan Also known that Crohn 's can turn into colorectal cancer , and spread
0	I 've read that ascites is not usually something that happens right away Usually more of a late stage thing , for whatever it ends up being
0	Sorry this is so long   so my questions are 1 is this story familiar to anyone , and if so , please share
0	2 Any ideas on why they could n't remove much
0	Does the thickness or color tell us anything
0	3She is in so much pain Any home remedies for the rib pain the ascites is causing
0	Could n't give ibuprofen because of the blood thinning property and her just getting the paracentesis
0	Does heating pad help or hurt
0	Ice
0	Thanks for any advice , info , or words
0	I have been on most of the SSRI 's and a whole host of other things
0	Exercise and diet totally play a role , but I ca n't diet away a chemical imbalance
0	I have just started telling people it 's bipolar and maybe it is
0	I do n't know if it 's allowed to ask
0	It would be nice to hear a voice on the other end of the line and say hey has your doc tried this or that
0	See what I live with
0	Just ca n't do it now with no job and freaking out on a daily basiskinda hard to get a job
0	The day will come soon
0	I did not hear a voice , but it may have been what Christians call spiritual impression
0	From there on out my thoughts became increasingly grandiose and delusional
0	she was most definitely an inspiration for this
0	However , effects of that period lingered and still do
0	is there anyone who can figure out whether the aforementioned symptoms and delusions were those of schizophrenia
0	Thanks ,   Malon93
0	We have friends of the family whose 40 something daughter has severe schizophrenia and is bipolar
0	She was not always this way
0	She is paranoid and hallucinates
0	brain tumor , stroke , etc , in case there is something physical causing her mental health problems
0	When someone is critically ill or injured in the hospital , they do n't wait for their permission to run it
0	Thanks
0	Please help me
0	I am in pain , full of anxiety , and desperate for some relief or release
0	I am suicidal with violent fantasies
0	While I am working with a psychologist to try to address some of these issues , the help is not enough
0	I was raised in a very abusive environment
0	My step father was an abusive drug dealing diabetic who was mentally unstable himself
0	Things were going fine until just before I escaped
0	Once here I eventually became a very good carpenter
0	I was good enough as a carpenter to build custom homes worth millions
0	After the statutes of limitations ran out , I did not know how to be anything else
0	After truck driving I started going to school again
0	That ’s what I do now , study construction management
0	There are several cases of this happening after an inter articulate pain pump was used on a couple million people
0	The manufacturer of this pain pump is getting sued
0	In 26 days
0	I have lost the joy of life and pray for death constantly
0	I pray for death constantly , and am considering suicide
0	I am scared that will not stop the pain
0	25 years earlier it was reported that a man had shot himself in that house
0	Short of a killing spree there is nothing to be had , not even an apology from a greedy pharmaceutical company
0	All of this has left me feeling unworthy
0	I do not know what else to do
0	It will never get better and there is nothing that anybody can do about it
0	I have stopped going to school at shortly after turning 15
0	I was around 7 or 8 at this time
0	Things a child at that age should never know or hear
0	I was fine at first and had friends and did things
0	Instead of going outside with friends i 'd come home from school and sleep
0	Or i 'd hop straight into bed and never get out
0	Although I only feel this way about myself and will always try to help out anyone in need
0	So I do n't really look forward to getting married having kids
0	I do n't self harm because of this though
0	So no i do n't really have a support group either
0	okay , so lately i ve been feeling like crap
0	do i have depression or any signs
0	if so should i seek help
0	The worst part is No one is missing me
0	They are both very confident and very popular
0	I 'm very self conscious , but not really shy
0	I have a therapist , but it 's not helping
0	I 'm so scared and alone
0	Does anyone have any advice
0	Please help me
0	I do n't want to discourage anyone from having a nodule removed or having a biopsy
0	Doctor at that time said lets watch
0	He recommended removing to be sure
0	It involved 3 nurses in a small operating room and my urologist , who performed the surgery
0	Surgery went well
0	Less than 20 minutes in the OR for the doctor
0	Maybe an hour total time for each nurse
0	I 'm glad to know for sure that it was nothing
0	Insurance negotiated it to about 6,100
0	My share turns out to be about 2,400
0	Imagine if I was a low end wage slave with no insurance
0	I 'd be billed the entire 9362 with no negotiation
0	Let 's apply a little reason here
0	Actual time in surgery was no more than 20 minutes
0	Operating Room Rental 1 hour at 500
0	Wild gues but why would a small tiled room cost more than this
0	So where does the additional 6,500 come from
0	Can anyone clarify
0	Its so hard
0	Husband was n’t in agreement , because it was an ‘ accident’
0	WTF
0	Husband can make mistakes , get mad or yell at the kid … I do that , and it causes a fight
0	I ca nt take it
0	Everything I do it wrong
0	Everything I do n’t do is wrong
0	I do n’t get any reward from that kid
0	No hugs , no ‘ I miss you’ nothing
0	I do n't know what to do to be heard
0	I 'm so scarred
0	I should have known
0	Internet sites are just like the outside world
0	Thank you
0	I have recently joined this group and have posted a few comments
0	This all has nothing to do with my mom but it will all tie together in a second
0	Does anyone have any advice as to what I should do
0	Please , someone give me some insight as to what this could be
0	Thank you

0	The sensations are irritable tingly feeling in the spine or a dead depression feeling , anxiety and sometimes I feel happy
0	These sensations happen throughout the day
0	A analogy of how I feel is when a light is flickering off and on
0	Could this be Somatization disorder
0	along with agitated or psychotic depression
0	I just really wanted some one to talk to
0	This is what s hapenning now
0	Could this be stress related
0	My son has always been a little shy   exceptionally caring giving optimistic clean helpful , hardworking   ambitious

0	Thank you
0	I 've got fibromyalgia , osteoarthritis and hypocalcemia

0	due to getting screwed over by people
0	Have assets but ca n't sell
0	I 'm deparate to leave
0	Are there places that would help me in these circumstances
0	Please any help would be appreciated
0	Thanks , Linda
0	39yo Male
0	Pretty healthy and fairly active
0	Have since smoked other thingswell , one specific thing to be certain
0	Drink on occasion , but not a heavy every day drinker
0	Stress definitely makes this worse
0	Looking down and then up quickly also exacerbates it
0	So began the hunt for why I was dizzyshaky all the time
0	That came back OK Vertigo tests VNG did not show signs of vertigo
0	Yes , I might be a hypochondriac
0	The consistency of the stools was never that of diarrhea , usually wellformedbut soft
0	I would notice the smell as rather nasty as well
0	When I would flush , the stool would disintegrate into a cloud of fecal matter before exitinglike a puff of brown smoke
0	My fears were growing at that point
0	Also , I noticed upper leftcenter abdominal achediscomfort in addition to the dull back ache
0	All bloodwork came back normal
0	This was normal
0	Worse after eating
0	The doctor felt maybe it would be a good idea to perform an endoscopy to check out my upper end since the lower end was already checked
0	I have been experiencing fatigue for a while now , but it seems to be worse
0	Coupled with the dizziness it is unpleasant to say the least
0	All symptoms still exist
0	It 's clear and sometimes hard to see
0	It 's not like a bottle of Wesson was dumped in there , but its definitely an oil slick
0	• Pain in upper left abdomen   side   back   shoulder
0	Seems worse lately and definitely worse after eating , usually a 12 hour or so afternot sure if fat content has anything to do with the pain
0	It might
0	Ca n't think of anything else
0	The good • No loss in weight • No loss in appetite • No nausea • No jaundice • so far lab results have been favorable
0	• Dr is confident it is not cancer
0	I am a stupid
0	  so I get a webcam and start stripping on it for people from a chat room
0	WRONG
0	I felt like the biggest   and backstabbing   ever
0	  so here is the kind of cyber bullying messages I get from people , here is the worst one WHIPCREAM
0	HAHAHA  
0	your a little
0	do nt ever say that
0	and being bi just means your confused
0	like jp jean phillipe that s gross and your a firecrotch
0	which is even more disgusting
0	and where s your little friend melanie
0	but you are a fire crotch gross
0	really gross
0	like i wanna vomit
0	my life sucks
0	I am a
0	people hate me
0	people tell me to go die
0	I have unrelyable friends for support
0	I have become an angry person , from the quiet one in class who does n't speak a word , from the angel the good one amoung the family   to this disgusting diesease filled , angry , nasty ,
0	no one can help me and prob no one read this cuz its too long
0	Like things do n't line up right
0	It 's like my world has shrunk immensely
0	I get stuck in this cycle and nothing seems to exist except trying to occupy myself
0	When I try to think it 's just nothing
0	This is the best that I can think of
0	I feel like there is such a big world out there with so much in it
0	I just ca nt find it
0	Thanks for reading and for your time
0	I 'll jump into this , which may take a while
0	First , I 'll discuss the relationship and potential red flags
0	I have been single or in shorter relationships
0	She 's beautiful , smart , and intelligent
0	I was attracted to this
0	This is another area where my insecurities shine through
0	She also explained that partners may hang out less as the relationship progresses , but at the beginning hanging out a lot is normal
0	ca nt i have this
0	These feelings of emptiness and restlessness progress to nothingness and makes me feel down and depressed
0	I look around the room and wonder how everyone else is happy and content
0	That 's the ' emotion   feeling ' kind of part
0	Second part is the physical
0	If anyone knows anything about this , please feel free to help me
0	I got the help
0	It 's a huge load off
0	It 's not a new thought , but it keeps coming to me , it sounds better and better every time
0	But that 's not really the point of this post
0	What is the point is what I should do
0	I 'm a pansy that ca n't gather up the guts to just get over whatever this is
0	But I do n't know what to do
0	I have researched quite a bit about chemical dependency , depression , the whole works
0	There was a small stretch of time when I was feeling better not normal , but better but this inability to gain pleasure or joy is the worst feeling yet
0	Or is this just depression resulting from it
0	I have seen many Drs and a few psychs
0	and I just never can get a clear cut answer as to their best guess what is going on
0	Has anyone on here been seriously anhedonic and found the right med and had their life come back and feel like them old selves
0	Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated
0	
0	We talked and talked and talked   And talked
0	It just did n't stop
0	It was intense
0	It was bliss
0	She got colder , more distant
0	Argued more
0	Just was n't right
0	Cold shoulder the entire trip
0	She ended it
0	Just like that
0	Cold and heartless no call or face to face just that was it
0	I was crushed
0	I could n't sleep
0	My future
0	How
0	That was it
0	Just like that all gone
0	I 'm still so hurt by it
0	How can someone be so cruel and for no reason
0	Where 's the decency and respect gone
0	I now know that there is no doubt about it
0	That one talk with my parents did n’t help much
0	What I really want is a break
0	A break from everything
0	I just really feel pathetic for it though
0	Is n’t it a bit too early to be tired of life when you ’re only 14
0	For a while I ’ve been thinking about seeking help at a therapist
0	I just do n’t know if it will help
0	I ca n’t see how it will
0	Again , I just feel pathetic
0	And it really would be nice to just hear anything helpful
0	Thank you for reading this
0	Is it normal to have any pain from it
0	Is this normal to feel so much pain
0	So much has been going on these past few months and idk how to deal with it anymore
0	I constantly find myself breaking down and having panic attacks
0	Hello
0	I am now not allowed to go out anywhere , use phone or internet
0	I was among toppers in studies
0	But i ca nt get in
0	I need a solution to this
0	, keeping it all legal and mostly as prescribed to not be abusing anything
0	Fortunately , it 's all been without incident
0	I know that wo n't last
0	My major issues are anxiety , ADHD , and depression from life 's frustrations
0	Is there anything that is indicated for giving you a little pep in life 's step that is n't abused
0	Meanwhile , I am trying to find something that helps
0	Anyone help is appreciated
0	Getting some help at school and i guess from two friends
0	My other friend is suicidal so ya
0	Ok so i like do n't really like very many things anymore
0	I m only interested in like a couple of things
0	Like i like writing screen plays and playing guitar
0	But besides that I would rather die
0	But i m pretty sure its never going to get better
0	I ve always dealt withthis
0	And now it just really hurts
0	like i pretty much take suicide as a one time thing
0	If your going to do it do it right
0	so like I m just not sure if it will work
0	Like a lot of family and a couple friends i do nt have many
0	so glad I found this site
0	had to have other testing done to roll out other issues
0	and drive the people around me crazy too
0	Thanks
0	Or do i have something
0	I do n't know what to do
0	Am i just being lazy
0	I feel reluctant to do any task
0	I am a new member
0	Any ways let me try
0	And I thought that everything is going well
0	And some times she is laughing without any reason
0	And is there any possibility to regain her concentration back to normal naturally
0	I was quite angry , impulsive and unstable as a child
0	Saying this there are of course times when I was happy
0	Things began to get really bad about three years ago
0	Screaming at people   abusing them , running away , trying to hurt myself
0	There were countless times I cut myself with knives , broken glass and tried to throw myself out windows or into the canal
0	I felt so alone and so depressed
0	After that things got worse
0	It helped even just knowing what was wrong
0	The only problem is I 'm starting to get worse
0	I feel so empty all the time
0	I have cut myself a few times recently
0	its really helped me to write this even it no one reads or replies
0	My mind has launched the seemingly inevitable process of failure
0	Reality unravels itself with each prolific image the inner eye projects , as every waking moment I dream
0	Presumably tangible fabrications swiftly weave to mend the dropped stitches , to quench the evergaping fissures
0	The tapestry now warped with various illusive memories is woven with unreal perceptions , dreams and goals
0	The original piece a sad shadow , teased through a nightmarish image of insanity
0	I had countless xrays , upwards of 50
0	I prob am forgetting some too
0	Does nt this put me at an extreme risk now
0	I am really having a panic attack
0	Has anyone had a lot of radiation tests and NOT gotten cancer years later because of it
0	Hi , I 've been in a relationship with someone with an anger problem
0	They always have to choose which one of us to invite to events
0	
0	If there is such a thing as normal when it comes to relationships
0	Here 's the real dilemma
0	The cheating is n't the issue
0	It 's this child
0	Well the child really is n't the issue either
0	The child is innocent in all of this
0	The real concern is whether I can deal with being married to a woman who is having a child from another man
0	I fear it 's too late
0	The question What if it is my child
0	Please give me some advice
0	Sorry for the randomness and rambling please ask questions if anything is unclear
0	It feels really good to finally get this off my chest
0	Well , I 'm currently a student
0	I 've always loved learning , and am a straight A student
0	It 's like this huge internal conflict
0	My attention span and focus have simply gone down the drain
0	And it has gotten to this point where it 's been really affecting me
0	But I did not
0	Now , I 'd like to reinstate that this is not a case of sheer laziness
0	I am really just lost and completely hopeless right now
0	I am really so scared
0	I am now on a low dose of SSRI
0	It has somewhat helped to calm me down , but has n't helped otherwise
0	I want to get over this
0	I would really appreciate any advicehelp
0	Thank you
0	I am now 16 and can never forget about it
0	Does this situation count as child molestation
0	Is this a serious issue
0	I mainly want to know if this is real molestation or just kids being curious
0	Helping someone recieve support and treatment is essential but before that can be approached the person must understand there is something wrong in their life
0	That they need help to begin with
0	As well I understand only a psychiatrist can make a diagnosis but its hard for a person to approach the idea of borderline personality disorder because the term sounds so ugly
0	Since this comes up from time to time , how can you help someone understand this aspect of their life
0	If people are diagnosed with it how did you come to terms with the diagnosis and accept it
0	And what is a good way to help someone else do so in a supportive fashion
0	Any ideas
0	Ugh point
0	So , I do n't know how to respond
0	I am sick of the drama
0	I 've had a lot of it
0	I really am sick of going down that road too
0	and then I remember and go back and forth and back and forth help
0	Bearhitch
0	The child poops his pants on a regular basis , wet the bedwears pull ups is overly compliant when the stepmother is around
0	His room is usually picked up but it smells horrible
0	I have become very close to this man since that time
0	His immediate response was Stress
0	I put alot of pressure on myself to perform
0	You can imagine the stressit was constantbutsome of it was selfimposed
0	Anywaymy point isstress has caused several different health problems for me
0	Think about ittheir national comment is Soon come which translated in American means on it 's waysome day
0	It costs a lot and it runs everything in your world when it goes out , it 's dark and nothing works
0	Morethanhuman , confident , quickwitted , creative , funny and ohsocharmingly handsome
0	Who would wanna shake that feeling
0	The tail side of the coin is a person who withdrawls from Everything important who will not communicate to anyone , no returned phone calls , emails , texts   completely vacant and disconnected
0	Not terribly depressed , just unmotivated , void of esteem and energy and in the throes of deep thought
0	UNCOPING skills of life
0	I will not survive if this continues
0	I found a place that looks really strong
0	It has a year commitment with one individual session a week one group per week and weekly phone sessions
0	Is there anyone , who can relate to the Rock'emSock'em robot lifestyle of the BorderlineBiPolar mashup who has any experience with Dialectical Behavioral Therapy DBT
0	I would love to hear from someone who has walked in those shoes
0	Thanks
0	I have tried it twice before by drinking some drugs but it did n't work
0	My grades are low
0	I often cry myself to sleep
0	But he turned out to be a jerk
0	Our relationship was based on lies
0	I keep making the same mistakes over and over
0	I do n't know what to do
0	I really want to life   have a happy life
0	I feel lost   trapped
0	I just do n't know what to do
0	My life seems so useless , meaningless   hopeless
0	I feel so completely lonely
0	Please help
0	what should I do1
0	I took on some pretty bad anxiety that grew into severe paranoia
0	So bad that I stopped going out altogether
0	Literally
0	Little Miss Social Butterfly who loves people , and socializing , shut herself out from the world
0	I ca n't stop it
0	I am convinced lately that cameras are in public bathrooms
0	I hear it talking
0	Another special little gift or curse I 've been given is the ability to read minds
0	Again , not something I could always do
0	I do it to people all the time
0	Ok , what else
0	Nothing works
0	I was never known as the depressed type and do NOT live a depressing life in the least
0	Here 's the thing
0	I 'm not stupid
0	She just could n't come out and say it
0	Which , I take offense to
0	no pun intended
0	No , absolutely not
0	I 'm scared to see a psychiatrist
0	I do n't go out much
0	And , I do n't trust people , to be quite honest
0	I have previously been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety
0	Is there any natural ways to control it or make myself not think of bad thoughts
0	what is your opinion or experience on the effects of pornography addiction and the partner

0	Peri menopause
0	The blood is not heavy or light , sort of what it 's usually like mid cycle and it 's bright red
0	Around day 7 it seemed to be letting up a bit but now it seems to be getting a tiny bit heavier every day , not heavy just heavier
0	It was n't cramping pain more like a sharper pain
0	Do you think this could be the early stages of menopause
0	A cyst
0	Something else

0	Hello , I need some advice
0	I have been having left upper quad
0	abdominal pain for about 3 years
0	The MRI and vaginal ultrasound came back fine
0	Since 607 I have had an obstructed bowel , constipation , and still continued abdominal pain
0	My colonoscopy came back normal
0	I have also been tested for celiac disease and that came back normal
0	I also was tested to cystic fibrosis and that was normal
0	Also , all other blood test were normal , CBC , amylase , lipase , liver enzymes , etc
0	Am I too young to have pancreatic cancer
0	Is there anything else aside from the workup already done on me that can give a false high
0	Why was n't my pancreas checked
0	Is pancreatic cancer a possiblitiy
0	Yeah
0	Okay
0	So that just caused him to be more depressed
0	He also has a bad sleeping habitHe does n't sleep well at night
0	So , I 'm sorry if that stuff is just kind of off in tangent
0	If you know of anything that could help us , it would be very much appreciated
0	I slowly with hindsight became more wound up , racing thoughts about the bereavement
0	I thought that it was the bereavement process
0	I went for counselling
0	No progress
0	The Valdoxan caused this reaction , severe
0	But somehow i did nt ' click ' this , because of all the media hype about it
0	That it had few if any side effects
0	Hello all
0	I will appreciate all inputssuggestions
0	He then suggested an ultrasound by a radiologist
0	But still said its fine
0	ME SUPER CONFUSED
0	This happened in the first week of July
0	The ENT 's assistant tried feeling lymph other lymph nodes in the jaw , throat , back of the head , arm pits but there were n't any
0	My answer to that was no
0	I have never had any sexual relationship no sexual intercourse
0	But that does n't cause any of those
0	A NEGATIVE Rapid test got rid of that anxiety for me
0	No pain and tender to feel
0	What can it be
0	Can this be any sign of cancer
0	No other symptoms   no weight loss , no night sweats etc
0	At the time we were discussing getting back together and ended up sleeping together
0	He used a condom
0	He did not mention the condom breaking or anything
0	The weight gain has n't been much but about fivesix pounds
0	There 's no way that eating 1500 calories and working out 67 days a week this can be possible
0	Help is much wanted
0	I have even been accussed of drug seeking
0	A little history , I am diabetic juv
0	type 1 in good contrl on insulin pump
0	I have had MRI after MRI , a list of blood tests that go a mile long , xrays , eeg 's , ekg 's etcetc
0	Guess what they all come back negative
0	Then someone throws a fybromyalgia label on me and now that is the excuse for everything
0	and throwing up from the pain
0	Can it all be stress
0	its embarrassing
0	Please this has got to stop
0	Writing this massive essay alone made me feel better
0	I appreciate any feedback
0	This was not unique to me of course , but the problems continued
0	But I did have unique quirks
0	In middle school I did a 180˚
0	I became a very good student , and a very nervous one at that
0	The extreme transition from a cozy protected elementary school to an open and responsibilityfocused middle school was rough , for I became paranoid , and fearful of failure
0	I would frequently be sent to the guidance office , in a tearcovered mess
0	After 6th grade I calmed down a bit
0	Middle school was over , and then came high school
0	For 3 years
0	In highschool I became extremely paranoid , overcompulsive , and nervous
0	But hey , at least I had good grades right
0	I may be making it out to sound worse than it was
0	I graduated with an A average , and went to college
0	But then the work started getting harder
0	especially now that dearly loved relatives are passing away
0	This current semester is horrible
0	It does n't help that the courses are upperlevel courses , but I genuinely ca n't function
0	I 've felt like a complete zombie lately
0	I ca n't take tests anymore without exploding
0	All the information flies away , like dust in the wind and I 'm left dumbfounded
0	Fortunately at least I can still write , so there 's that
0	This anxiety and stress that has been a lifelong issue that has undermined me at every turn
0	But I do n't know what to think , or do
0	Anyway , there 's my story
0	I do n't know what is wrong
0	Thanks for reading , and even if you did n't this helped tremendously
0	Hi
0	But , I am struggling quite a bit with depression
0	I have researched a lot about various deficiencies , mainly serotonin and dopamine
0	The only problem is that Wellbutrin should not be taken when one has an eating disorder
0	I am not quite sure what this means
0	Are they referring to people with active eating disorders who are in a compromised medical state and more prone to seizing , or will anyone who has ever had an eating disorder be denied this med
0	  but instead for its apparent success rate
0	Or would they have to recommend it
0	Sorry this is kind of confusing and scattered , but I am new to the medication world
0	Thank you so much
0	
0	The rest of the time   no sweating
0	Also , there seems to be no difference in quantity of sweat based on dream content   nightmares are pretty equal in volume to happy dreams
0	One thought is that the Effexor could be interacting with the nicotine   is this possibleprobable
0	This sweating is really disgusting and dehydrating
0	Please , any thoughtsadvice you have would be appreciated
0	It is super hard to stay awake during school and even harder to wake up on the morning let alone actually get out of bed
0	Here recently , things have n't gotten any better more like worse
0	Along with this , morning 's ALWAYS bring nausea and dizziness total weakness
0	It consists of red bumps , although they are n't raised , that itched at first
0	Now , the itching has completely subsided , and the red spots look and feel like bruises
0	Soon after , and over all feeling of aching took over
0	Following this , a lymph node on the left side of my neck became swollen , and still is
0	It is tender to the touch , but not exactly painful
0	The practicioner eventually gave me a streptest , which came back negative
0	The lady was baffled , because she had convinced herself that that was the case
0	Random bruises started appearing , which was happening , but not to this extent
0	Number one , I do n't have allergies , number two , how could this be a virus
0	Well , this did n't happen
0	The doctor barely looked over me either
0	I was simply told to come back if it gets worse
0	If it was going to go away , would n't it be gone already
0	This stuff started months ago
0	Am I going crazy , or is this stuff actually happening or even related in any way
0	I have no one to go to and talk about this with , so any comments or replies are appreciated
0	I would just like to be needed more than just as a babysitter
0	I 'm the only one that can make myself happy
0	I do n't have really any close friends
0	Life seems pretty lonely
0	Panic attacks are disabling
0	I just do n't know where to go from here
0	Just want some real happiness for myself and not from others
0	He is always needing money on school functions like this
0	He is so bright , cheerful , funny , friendly , and intelligent

0	Any advice

0	What signs does a guy that gets raped show
0	The thought of being raped is killing me
0	I need help
0	On examining my groin , the doctor felt a very painful swelling which seemed to be a lymph node
0	After a couple of months , the pains seemed to go away on their own
0	I was also suffering abdominal pain and was having problem with stools
0	The doctor said that my groin lymph nodes were swollen , but not in a way that suggested malignancy
0	Both seemed to come back normal
0	I have had 4 blood tests
0	One showed ' low lymphocytes ' , but the doctor said he was not concerned
0	Another was for HIV and other STDs , all of which were negative
0	I also feel very , very tired
0	I am now worried sick
0	However , I have since found out that lymphoma will not necessarily show up in these tests , and the only way to know for sure is a node biopsy
0	Please can anybody help with advice on this

0	Too long have I been put up with this
0	I 'm going no where in life

0	I 'm studying a LawCommerce degree
0	Received terrible grades GPA   46 and is way behind the pack of 1st year students
0	2
0	I 'm working fulltime
0	Well , I was
0	Earning 12hr MondayFriday
0	I 'm struggling to earn 200 wk and mum takes 180 off that for board
0	I 'm going no where in terms of savings
0	Getting a ' dead end ' job in a small business and constantly criticised when it 's not necessary
0	3
0	I 'm not a smart person , just an extremely hard worker
0	4
0	5
0	Particularly when I moved to a different suburb and have to rely on technology to keep in touch
0	6
0	I ca n't talk to anyone
0	Not once did a friend ask how I was or how was uni etc
0	7
0	I had a terrible life
0	I just do n't react and asorb the moment
0	I 'm going no where in life
0	A lot of people could do better then I can
0	Never had a girlfriend , financially broke , no one to talk to , just a   up life at the moment
0	Yet I never seem to react and just keep things bottled up
0	Now I 'm worried that it 's going to happen
0	The rest of the time is filled up with household chores
0	I just do n't have time to ' become a teenager so to speak '
0	I took a gamble and it did n't pay off
0	NOT ONE SINGLE BIT
0	Thank you
0	I 'd be happy straight , bi or gay
0	I just ca n't figure it out
0	I have experimented with many , many males and equal amount with females

0	I have a small income , but it 's not enough to just up an leave
0	Thank you
0	I was jumping rope bare foot on the cement quite hard and fast
0	The pain lasts for only half a second at a time and then goes away
0	However , it comes roughly every 410 minutes all day , every day for the past 11 days
0	No more than one area hurts at any given time
0	This led to ongoing period pain that was treated and resolved by physical therapy and posture correction
0	Anyone have any information that may be useful
0	I 'm usually just quiet and kinda in the background most of the time
0	Any advice will be welcomed with open arms
0	Most of the time , that is the brunt of what I eat each day
0	I m thinking this is anorexia induced by anxiety
0	Is that possible
0	What could I start to do about this
0	Anyone else share a similar experience
0	
0	My husband had a child from a previous relationship
0	Thanks
0	Usually it is being bullied at school that makes teenagers suicidal , not being bullied by their parents
0	I have tried to commit suicide once but failed
0	They are also so cheap
0	What can I do
0	Below is an approximation of how the appointment went including most of the key things hat were said
0	I repeatedly asked for some further professional help but felt fobbed off
0	Me Im’not enjoying myself
0	Dr How do you mean
0	Dr Have you had thoughts of harming yourself
0	Dr Have you made any plans along those lines
0	Well sort of
0	It ’s difficult to explain
0	I just feel low enough every day to be thinking it ’s the best way out – and it ’s been getting worse and more often
0	How long have you felt like this
0	Dr And was the Citalopram helping
0	Me Ok
0	I toss and turn at night
0	Sometimes all night
0	Other times I over sleep
0	I ca n’t concentrate on things
0	I feel shaky
0	Like I am fizzing inside
0	It feels like agony
0	More or less never
0	I ’m just low
0	This is n’t just the last month it ’s a couple of years , and also in the past
0	Just until recently I was burying it inside
0	Would you mind filling in this form though first
0	Dr gives me a form with the standard depression questions on it
0	4 out of 5 for two and 2 out of 5 for one question Do you move around a lot
0	Is there somebody I can talk to though
0	Dr writes down the name of a local charity where volunteers give of their time and passes it to me
0	They are based in the town centre
0	There is also the Samaritans if you just need to talk to someone at some point
0	Me Oh
0	Dr Have you got access to the internet at home
0	Me Yes
0	Have you heard of it
0	I am really struggling though to deal with things and think seeing somebody professionally could help
0	I am falling apart inside
0	Here is your prescription ohhhkayyyy
0	Me Ok thanks , take care
0	Bye
0	Sorry about the long post
0	Hope you managed to stick with it
0	Does anyone have some advice which could help
0	See someone else
0	I 'm a bit lost
0	I manipulate others
0	I do n't feel empathy for others
0	I do n't feel love for others either
0	I 'm secretive and paranoid
0	I 've abused others and animals and never felt bad
0	I do n't care who gets hurt or offend
0	I 'm always bored
0	I day dream about ways others could die that would benefit myself
0	I also have always been fascinated by serial killers and have even sent letters to different ones in prison
0	
0	i mean holy
0	god wtf
0	hello
0	why is there so many thots about suicide running through my head
0	how do i deal with it
0	
0	I do n't see a point to life anymore
0	Everyone who does nt have any freinds hangs out with her
0	and EvelynI had a crush on her
0	In 7th grade nothing really new happened
0	Hung out with the same people
0	In 8th grade I made a new friendLawrence
0	He was very loyal
0	I was really upset and got very depressed for a while
0	In fact it was sort of the opposite
0	It got so out of hand that her parents found out and called the police
0	I was going to have to go to court
0	The girl was in too deep to admit she had lied
0	Fortunately I got a new lawyer who set up a meeting with the DA
0	I was devastated
0	Since then my depression got really bad and its stayed that way
0	Ever since then I started having thoughts of Suicide
0	It got very hard to concentrate on anything ever since then
0	After all that I stopped doing any school work
0	It helped to know there was someone there that cared
0	Nothing new really happened in 9th grade
0	In 10th grade one of the things that I had been praying for to happen finally happened
0	Brandon left
0	Frank wanted to be friends with again
0	That decision still haunts me
0	School work gets a lot harder , have more trouble concentrating
0	Its 11th grade now
0	I do n't really have a friend anymore
0	I do n't see the point of anything anymore
0	What s the point of me staying alive
0	If I commit suicide it 'll be like taking a short cut
0	My imagination runs wild but can feel very real at times
0	Now this friend has had fibromyalgia for Yeats and the symptoms have become progressively worse including having to leave the workforce because of it
0	It did n't go that way , and I feel more judged and made fun of than ever
0	Just talk without having to change my feelings or snap out of it
0	This person has almost made a sport out of finding the fault in my own stars while their own narcissism is off limits
0	And sometimes I have this feeling that no one really caresand no one really understandsexcept other people who have depression
0	I always over analyze things which makes life ever harder
0	He seemed very excited about having a girlfriend but it ended for some reason
0	I have read that there is some connection between sz and feeling transgender but there is n't a lot of information linking the two
0	Nothing definite
0	Someone who knows more than the Dr he sees now
0	He is a wonderful person
0	Can anyone chime in on this
0	Thank you all so much
0	How do you wean off this medication slowly and safely
0	It happens every time the doctors have tried
0	I recall having some anxiety as a small child but it was easily resolved
0	I was in a good mental and physical state before dropping acid
0	As time passes the intensity of the anxiety and panic tapers off
0	The effects were getting stronger and stronger
0	I had also heard from another friend that eating would dull a trip
0	I decided to eat an apple , which in retrospect was idiotic considering it could have fueled the trip
0	She has severe anxiety and accelerated heart beat
0	My heart began racing even faster
0	My heart beat peaked at 160 beats per minute
0	We left around nine
0	That the experience would somehow permanently damage me
0	I went to this site tripsitme
0	it calmed me down enough
0	I ate very little dinner and went to bed
0	The anxiety is becoming less intense and my heart beat is n't accelerating as much
0	I 've been running recently to feel better
0	I felt at the time completely normal
0	I need some answers
0	What 's going on and is it normal
0	I 've ceased smoking and really all drugs , including caffeine
0	Will I be okay
0	I need some brutal honesty
0	Pointing to my nether regions
0	Is there anything wrong with lounging in a t shirt and underwear around my step son
0	Sorry , it 's long
0	Maybe some of you have comments
0	We both are over 30
0	Also his family story hints towards that direction
0	For professional reasons I had to move to the same country but a different city
0	Our short time affair was taking on shape
0	I always found returning home very hard
0	Then he started to talk about marriage
0	I just would n't do that with anyone after having met only four times
0	Also , trust had become difficult
0	Since that he 's been wanting to quit the relationship three times
0	Last time was two days ago
0	There 's no compromise in love as he said
0	These episodes alterated with extremely attentive and lovable behaviour
0	The last time we saw each other it was very special
0	We went out dancing , going to the beach , it was magic
0	I could definitely feel it was mutual
0	I felt so happy
0	We were supposed to talk in the evening on skype
0	Then he was crying , saying that it 's not good to love
0	Everybody before had left him , love always causes pain , etc
0	I 'd read in forums about the different phases people go through
0	He had forgotten about it
0	The answer was only thanks
0	Otherwise it would be finished
0	This again is emotional blackmail
0	I do n't know anymore what to do
0	I wanted the relationship to develp solid ground before getting into marriage
0	Being left every second week does n't really contribute to that
0	Does anyone have an idea how to get out of this situtation with its repeating pattern
0	Many thanks
0	We met online and had wonderful time together
0	Yet I can be stupid sometimes
0	Everything seriously was great
0	While working there was another girl who would alwasy look at me
0	It basically turned into cyber sex
0	In the middle of it though it hit me
0	What was I doing
0	I will just cry
0	I try and get myslef to do things
0	Its like I do nt know what to do anymore
0	Is there anyone who has any words of advise
0	tips
0	or if you have any questions feel free to ask
0	•
0	Tiredness
0	So tired I have missed work resulting in losing jobs , and ca n't wake up to alarms • bad forgetfulness
0	• ache
0	More down below Very painful and regular • suicidal
0	I was n't cold or hot
0	Hi everyone
0	My question is can crying and stress harm the baby
0	Not the crying that last for a moment but the deep crying that makes you feel broke down
0	I just do n't feel appreciated at all
0	I should have just did it myself because now it 's in worse condition
0	I 've seen two different doctors , the first one twice a week apart
0	The first gave me Ativan for managing anxiety
0	On to the symptoms It all started with a feeling of dizziness , almost lightheadedness
0	It was n't the kind of dizziness that would make me fall it was maybe more like disorientation
0	Anyway , it has progressed
0	This original symptoms continued when I tried to sleep
0	I would have a hard time falling asleep and then would wake up several times in the night , sometimes panicked
0	New symptoms include feeling drowsy during the day , like the feeling one gets when just waking up except for a long time
0	This was sometimes accompanied by some big amounts of yawning
0	Also , this drowsiness combined withcaused a kind of brain fog , a feeling of detachment from everything around me that made it hard to focus
0	Oddly enough , I have started to feel hopeless and emotionally blunted over about that same period of time
0	Also , I get an extremely tired feeling but unable to sleep due to dizziness
0	Finally , I just have a general feeling of ill health
0	What should I do
0	I 'm not going to get into complete details because it 's to much
0	Constantly made promises then broke them
0	Everything he said was a lie
0	I did start therapy
0	But I know if this did n't happen it would have been the same thing over and over
0	I am on thyroid medication and cortisol
0	I do not have any idea how to tell the difference between perimenopaus symptoms , menopaus symptoms , thyroid symptoms or cortisol symptoms
0	i know it is a precursor to estrogen and testosterone
0	She only took one of the 60 mg and the side effects were too much to deal with , the hot flashes and confusion were just too much
0	The first day without it was hell , still having the hot flashes and feeling extremely weak
0	The next day was slightly better but not much , still hot but very confused
0	Is there anything we can do to help with the withdrawals
0	The confusion is the absolute worst
0	I know it 's a strange question but maybe someone has tried it and has had success
0	I ca nt sleep in the dark
0	I shake and sweat and cry
0	This is every night
0	I have begun drinking to help myself fall asleep at night
0	Anything will help
0	Please
0	Thank you
0	We had problems from the beginning
0	We thought about dating but did n't
0	It terrified me
0	Eventually we stopped hanging with each other
0	So I finally gave in
0	I do n't know what to do at all for real
0	I feel so bad
0	I do n't know what to do
0	I found a way to keep it quiet
0	But that does n't mean that I do n't get depressed
0	I 'm not sure what else to do
0	Finally , I 'd like some advice generally on what to do
0	But I doubt there is
0	Anyway , I 'd like some advice on any or all of this if it 's possible
0	Thank you
0	Now , it all makes sense
0	What can I do about this
0	Help me in this
0

0	This heavy weight of whatever on my chest wo n't go
0	What 's wrong with me
0	I 'm seriously considering anti depressants
0	
0	The psychiatrist affiliated with the program has been wonderful and understanding , and prescribed 5 mg of Xanax four times a day to address the anxiety
0	I love food , but can not tolerate anything
0	Is it possible that some people just ca n't tolerate SSRIs
0	Are there alternative drugs that work
0	Would the older trycyclics be less stimulating

0	Can anyone tell me is this sounds familiar , or if it 's normal and nothing to worry about
0	Thanks everyone
0	How can this be
0	how without any retribution or justice can he have just changed
0	so no small thing to get over
0	how can this be
0	i just do nt believe in god or goodness anymore
0	After that it went back to normal like it never happened

0	That was five moths ago
0	So my question is , does anyone have any information about tapering off more than one drug at a time
0	I have always felt as though it would be best to do one at a time
0	But this tongue thing may become irreversible and that is why I am considering taper off more than one
0	Any links for info like this
0	Anyone have experience with this
0	Thank you
0	There is no respect for me at all
0	It just seem to get worse
0	And I 've said sorry over and over but no response
0	Is this my fault , and should this be a reason for divorce
0	He thinks that when people scratch their back or stretch their arms there is a hidden meaning
0	He has many delusions too many to mention
0	The judge denied it
0	It ended in a police car chase and a wreck
0	It is not just a teenage thingI have 5 childrenshe is the third
0	Any advice
0	Sorry for the book
0	Dear doctors , My dad has been diagnosed with cancer and also have some kidney stones
0	There are some tumors around his neck and armpits regions
0	Biopsy results confirmed carcinomas with less differentiated cells
0	Sonogram , Xrays , and some other tests confirmed the thyroid gland is not the origin
0	Localized and whole body PET scans also could n't find the origin
0	Now , there would be two choices , either doing surgery and followed by chemotherapy or starting with chemotherapy
0	Since the origin is unknown or not yet to determine , chemotherapy would be a general but not a specific targeted approach
0	And hopefully , there are some agents that could trigger a response and kill these tumor cells
0	That would avoid the risk or side effects involved with cancer surgery
0	However , these tumors are quite aggressive and growing fast
0	A surgery would help to remove these tumors but the origin is still there
0	A subsequence chemotherapy could help to control and maybe destroy the other possible small tumors that left behind during the surgery
0	That being said , when the chemotherapy is stopped and the origin is not treated
0	These tumors could come back again
0	Thank you so much
0	it 's almost like hormones are blocking out every normal part of me
0	As well as sadness , I break out horribly
0	What is a HEALTHY AND NATURAL way to feel better
0	I am not depressed
0	Let me clarify it is not just normal sadness
0	thank you for reading whatever this is
0	' preciate it
0	I feel like such a disgusting horrible scum bag who deserves to be thrown down the stairs
0	Even writing this hurts so bad it 's hard to even stop crying long enough to type correctly
0	The pain I feel is unbearable
0	We have been through illnesses and cheating
0	Family members dying
0	The relationship was very codependent
0	Previous times I have attempted suicide
0	That is awful , I am ashamed to admit that
0	We lived together
0	I am in debt
0	I need some guidance
0	Suggestions
0	What is the deal these days
0	Todays world is just so messed up have we lost the concept of true love an faithfullness is marriage just a piece of paper nowdays
0	When u got married in days of old U were married and that 's all there was to it
0	If u were n't in it for the long haul why would u do it
0	It just makes thing worse especialy when you start adding kids cuz really there the one that r going to pay the price
0	Things have been especially bad for the past several weeks
0	He isolates himself and becomes unresponsive
0	I feel really isolated and alone with this
0	Is there anything that actually helps
0	He was charged with criminal sexual conduct and the real culprit got nothing
0	My biggest problem lately has been severe anxiety and panic attacks , which after researching on the internet , have found to be a common occurrence with women who are thrown into surgical menopause
0	And , does anyone know of any natural treatments for anxietypanic attacks
0	Hello

0	Had a good summer
0	That time of year where its getting cold and dark
0	That dark cloud is trying to make its way back in my life
0	Been taking Wellbutrin for 5 or 6 months with some limited success
0	Anyone else feel the same way
0	Guess this is one of the approved uses for this drug
0	I 'm scared to take that step , to get on a slippery slope of taking more than one or multiple drugs
0	Was wondering if anyone here has taken Abilify and had success
0	I really do nt want to focus on the negative or listen to horror stories
0	I need some positive feedback

0	My sister suffers from a borderline personality
0	She was once a very beautiful woman , intelligent and charismatic but always tempermental , impulsive and always had stormy relationships husbands , work , friends , family

0	This post is n't a question
0	I just wanted to share an experience that might give people some hope with regards to coping with the sexual dysfunction often experienced on the SSRI class of drugs
0	
0	I love all of God 's creatures
0	It was sweet and playful
0	I made sure there were no cords or anything bad it could get into
0	I picked it up and it was completely limp
0	It was dead
0	There seemed to be a red stain around it 's mouth
0	I was so terrified
0	I was calling people at 3 am
0	Between that and losing a young puppy , my depression has been like an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10

0	Hello
0	I 've been feeling really low lately
0	Now it 's ended , we 've gone from seeing eachother everyday to now nothing
0	Girls do n't like loads of hair on a guy
0	Other people my age always seem really tall like 6 ft
0	I 'd be too embarrassed of myself to go to a gym
0	I know this is changeable but is this possible from home
0	3 I look young
0	I 'm 20
0	The one always getting ID checks
0	4 I 've got a fear of crowds

0	1 year on
0	Was thinking the worst and it turned out to be nothing
0	8 I really want to be a broadcast journalist   news reader
0	It 's my dream career
0	No one seems to want to listen to what I want to do in life
0	No one takes me seriously
0	9 I 've never found love
0	It felt good and hugging just feels like away to relive everything
0	I want to be confident and happy
0	I want a good long life
0	Where do I start
0	It 's been working really nicely for the most part
0	It did n't help
0	As of 2 days ago , the depression finally lifted on its own the way it does
0	I 'm scared because some of the potential side effects are really bad
0	Do any of y' all have experience with prozac , especially paired with lithium , that you 'd like to share
0	This may sound gross , butni was playing with my spit because it was sticky and such
0	But i stopped at an intersection
0	Kmart was no more then 5 minutes away from where the intersection was
0	What are the chances of me being pregnant
0	Please help me

0	I never understood the situation and still do nt
0	I am a recovering addict myself
0	Clean over 10 years
0	I do nt even count or pay attention to it anymore
0	She was sort of just there in the rehab facility
0	She still ca nt communicate
0	Mom and dad divorced when I was 18
0	It was hard on all of us
0	To this day none of us got an apology from mom
0	She tries to flip the script and even starts to cry sometimes
0	Like I prob need to talk to a shrink
0	Its gone , out the window
0	She just does nt seem with it anymore
0	No motivation at all
0	She wo nt even spend the time to put together a nice resume
0	She has gained so much weight at the same time
0	She is slowly killing herself
0	She never would have made it through the nursing program if so
0	I do nt know what to do
0	Sorry for rambling
0	Our relationship is going downhill and fast
0	She is right on target with a heart attach or stroke
0	I really do n't know what to do
0	I 'm worried about entering college , because college can be expensive , even if it 's community the school system here is so much different , not to mention complicating
0	So then what do I do
0	I have no idea what to do
0	I did not like it at all
0	I did not do that

0	Hi
0	I am a schizophrenic male
0	A while before I get schizophrenia , ca n't remember how long before
0	This event occured
0	I was only a young teenager , and easily tricked at the time
0	Later on I got schizophrenia
0	I know some substances have been identified as causes of schizphrenia
0	Over time I started with a small amount of paranoia , and gradually became more paranoid
0	Maybe I do not have schizophrenia but instead a similar illness from the laced marijuana
0	3 Where are some other places , I can ask other people about this
0	I would like to get multiple opinions
0	This is not my ideal of FamilyI'm feeling like moving on

0	Again
0	Some of my close friends do n't seem to really care either

0	And yup that s my life
0	oh and btw i have dry mouth at skl and sweaty hands
0	he replied with what the fk ever
0	
0	I really just need advice on healing from this broken heart
0	My story is long so please bare with it
0	We have 1 daughter
0	I live in a very small rural town
0	About 1000 ppl
0	The next city over is about a 20 min highway drive and is the only place anyone can find a job as jobs in my home town are extremely limited
0	Usually we are fighting alot before it happens
0	Not long later maybe a year it happens again
0	Stops talking starts avoiding me
0	Again there are signs of him bonding with another women again
0	He hates living here
0	He wants to go back
0	And things go very well for the next two years
0	Till now
0	Everything in our relationship seemed great
0	How he had been so romantic and caring
0	More than he has ever been
0	He had alot of credit card debits
0	This was a huge strain on our marriage
0	So I agreed to this
0	And signed the papers and the money was paid out
0	It was something he really wanted to do
0	  in all the last 3 separations this was what he 'd always say
0	I did it nicely
0	And he left
0	Nothing
0	Also the car was his
0	All in his name
0	I had no claim on it
0	He took it
0	At a great place great pay that I liked and it 's a 20 min highway drive everyday
0	Now I have no car to get there
0	I made a ton of mistakes
0	I was able to borrow cars for a while but that was a temporary solution
0	So it 's been 4 weeks now
0	He sends money the odd time not even close to any amount to support us
0	I went to legal aid and got a lawyer
0	Not because I wanted to
0	I do
0	I am a mess
0	I cry constantly
0	And this anger is so strong
0	But he has emotionally cheated countless times
0	He starts talking to a female coworker
0	But a boyfriend has never stopped him before
0	I am not
0	I did n't do that thus time
0	Never started any fights in the last 4 weeks
0	But I 'm still a mess
0	I feel so lost
0	My StepFather and Mother never got along
0	He took seizures and always laid in bed
0	The were the world 's perfect example of a horrible marriage
0	It was so late that it was into the next morning and everyone went to bed
0	He acted as if it was some kind of a joke
0	Other than that I just did n't know what to say
0	It was gross and very weird
0	This happened maybe 510 times along with other various sexual acts
0	Married with a 1 year old and a baby on the way
0	I just want to talk about this and get some feed back
0	Who was the one at fault
0	People often ignores me
0	He is often depressed also
0	I have also been through eight million therapists , doctors , PAs , psychiatrics , blah blah
0	But wait
0	There 's more
0	Just this past summer things becamedifferent
0	Worse
0	Unbearable
0	Then the rage took over
0	Unbelievable , unexplainable , irrational rage
0	I 'm the nicest person ever
0	So this is a total turn around and I CAN'T stop myself
0	It 's become daily , nightly
0	I have been inpatient once for trying to kill myself but that was BEFORE the borderline took place
0	Thanks for listening
0	Buspar helped my mental anxiety a little , but was n't enough
0	Besides SSRIs and benzos there really is n't much else to try
0	I know everyone reacts different to meds , but any input would be appreciated
0	It was the biggest mistake of my adult life
0	During this time I gained an extreme amount of wieght , was exausted all the time , had no sex drive and started to see symptoms of early male pattern baldness
0	The hair loss has added a huge amount of stress to my daily life
0	I was diagnosed as having a severe panic attack
0	Lately , things have been much better but not great
0	Too be honest it has been so long , I forget what great feels like
0	Does Pristiq make you feel great
0	Exaamples Naseau , Brain Zaps , , High Blood Pressure , Sand Shakes
0	and blurred vision are common in the 248 posts I read on Web Md
0	Not to mention the awful withdrawl symptoms associated with this drug
0	There has to be better options out there so I am wondering why anyone would take this medication
0	Questions 1 Would anyone who has ever taken this medication please tell me about their own experience on Pristiq
0	What do you feel like
0	2 Does the positive decrease in Anxiety and Stress outweigh the side effects
0	3 How do you feeel on this drug
0	How long have you been on it
0	Are you happy
0	Less depressed
0	Please describe
0	4 Considering the awful effects of witdrawl from this medication would you still have taken Pristiq
0	Describe the way in which you went off this medication

0	After baby he became more and more violent
0	He smoked cannabis alot
0	I got on the bus in time and told driver to GO
0	This time he has a solicitor
0	I am so scared
0	Thing is , there is something I have never told anyone
0	I do nt know what to do
0	About 6 yrs in , he was acting shady
0	Going out with friends and not coming home saying he drank too much and could n't drive
0	Then a bunch of money started to go missing and I found hotel charges in the bank acct
0	Which btw his behavior never changed over all that time
0	I 'm feeling a lot of regret and asking myself what if
0	All the time
0	Move on from both of them
0	Fast forward to this last weekend
0	Met a girlfriend and decided to go out dancing
0	I was flirting with someone and even somehow started talking about oral sex
0	All he kept saying was that it was ok
0	I do n't know what to do
0	I really do n't want anyone to know
0	Issues arose after marriage   living with his family
0	I refused
0	We have neither been trying hard to get pregnant or not get pregnant since then
0	Not to be too detailed , but this was so light that it was primarily on the toilet paper and only a tiny spot twice on my underwear
0	No cramping or feeling bad like a normal period
0	I am going to test again in the morning
0	I know that no one knows for sure , but anyone ever had a phantom period during menopause or in pregnancy
0	I feel horrible
0	Bad news is that even people who were at 375 to over 300 mg which is where I was , go through the same thing
0	I actually feel dead inside and ca n't fake being happy or normal
0	Some called this process that we who are withdrawing from an Effexor Nightmare
0	I ca n't do this anymore
0	I am totally miserable with myself
0	I do n't know even if this can be fixed
0	How much longer has this lasted for some of you and has anyone ever beat it
0	Always normal pap smears , no mention ever of fibroids etc
0	Normal period length of 56 days etc
0	I said a what
0	He ordered a vaginal and topical ultrasound which confirmed fibroidshe said one or two were fairly large
0	He said no cancer
0	Kind of the same scenario
0	Utrasound showed that one of the fibroids were possibly , slightly bigger , 2 millimeters
0	He said that there is a slight chance the fibroids can be cancerousalthough smallhe ca n't say 100
0	Of course nowI am scared to death
0	He was an alcoholic
0	He felt loved when family members expressed their love through physical affection   hugs , kisses , etc
0	I was probably 5 or 6 at the time
0	Sorry to go on so long
0	I just wonder if anyone here has any similar experiences or any advice
0	It 's really bothering me
0	Does anyone have any suggestions for safely recovering repressed memories
0	Hey can someone please help me

0	But I started hitting , calling and throwing things at people at every opportunity
0	I wanted to be genuinly angry
0	I did this to get attention
0	It was n't very bad in year nine but in year ten it was much worse
0	Things like how I was going to act
0	How many things I was going to do to get the attention
