Honeyville Rolled Oats is a delicious product.  I am using them to make a product designed to increase and enrich the milk production in lactating mothers.<br />The oats were shipped to me in a timely fashion and the amazing thing is I only paid $4.99 shipping for 50lbs of oats!  I encourage anyone who likes oats to order Honeyville Rolled Oats.  Their flavor is above all the rest.
