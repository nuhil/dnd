The product is of high quality, and has a rich full flavor.<br /><br />Delivery was unexpectedly fast.<br /><br />The only negative I would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack. While this may be commonplace, a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight, food grade, plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag.  Could be either a zip-lock bag or a twist tie closure... doesn't make any difference... just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it.<br /><br />This is a health and spoilage issue... 50#'s of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers (very expensive and hard to find}. I am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food security.  Long term storage is a big issue with people like me.<br /><br />Thom (Missouri)
