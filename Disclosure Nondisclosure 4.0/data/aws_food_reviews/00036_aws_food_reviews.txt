McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I'm a fan of the McCann's steel-cut oats, so I thought I'd give the instant variety a try. I found it to be a hardy meal, not too sweet, and great for folks like me (post-bariatric surgery) who need food that is palatable, easily digestible, with fiber but won't make you bloat.
