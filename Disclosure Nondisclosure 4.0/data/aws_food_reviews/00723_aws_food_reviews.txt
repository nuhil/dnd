These are the most fantastic chips I've ever had!  I could eat the whole bag myself!  They're made with lots of whole grain and beans, and make a complete protein, so I have no qualms about feeding them to my kids as snacks.  They are great!  The only problem I have with them:  The bag is too small!!!  We need a bigger bag!! :)
