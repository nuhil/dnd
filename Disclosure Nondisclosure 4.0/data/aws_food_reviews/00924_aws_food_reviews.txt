We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today. I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature (I put them in a bowl and microwave for 6-9 seconds) and taste ok. When I tasted this, I made a face because it was so yucky! I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon. To her credit, my (8 month old) daughter ate some bites, but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors. I like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein.
