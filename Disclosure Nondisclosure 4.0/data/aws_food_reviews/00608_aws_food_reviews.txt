These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're "kettle chips" and they're "fried" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!
