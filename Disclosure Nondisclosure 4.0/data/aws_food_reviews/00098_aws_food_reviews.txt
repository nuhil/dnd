Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods. The cheap 'you can buy it anywhere' food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets.  This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food.<br />This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved.
