I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it! I haven't made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! It's dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. It's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! I'm going to try making fesenjan next :-)
