Kettle brand chips are very crunchy.  I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the "soft" end of the "soft/crunchy" spectrum.  Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy.  If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand.  Otherwise, you'll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically.  Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor.  The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy!
