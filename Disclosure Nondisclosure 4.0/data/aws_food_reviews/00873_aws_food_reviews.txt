This product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award. The box only contains 5 bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal, so at least 50% of the interior of the box is air. Then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60% the length of a "normal" snack bar. The rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper. If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.<br /><br />As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, won't be disappointed in the taste of this one.<br /><br />I've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie. But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter.<br /><br />I really want to like this company. They seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process. That is why I've continued to try their products. I bought their granola many times, always wanting to like it, but it is some of the worst food I've ever had. The "clusters" are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than people.<br /><br />All in all I would not recommend Enjoy Life foods.
