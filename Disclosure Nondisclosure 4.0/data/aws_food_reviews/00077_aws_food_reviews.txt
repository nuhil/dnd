These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix.  Unfortunately, they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate.  I left them in my pantry for a few days, and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey.  I through them in the fridge and I've been breaking off hunks ever since.  They taste good to me, but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again.  I won't order them online again, but if I see them in a store I would pick them up.
