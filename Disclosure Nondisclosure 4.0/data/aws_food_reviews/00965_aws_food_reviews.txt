I love Panang Curry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurants serve with it.  So decided to try making my own, and with this product, I get exactly what I want, hot tasty Panang Curry adding lots of fresh veggies, tofu and brown rice.  And it's very hot, didn't have to add any spices at all.  Great product, will purchase again.
