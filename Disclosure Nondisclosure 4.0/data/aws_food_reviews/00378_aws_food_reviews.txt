Sir Kensington's did a great job of updating the classic ketchup with this wonderful product. The refreshed taste of this Ketchup is a great update, and now leaves me disappointed when I'm given Heinz while out at a restaurant.<br /><br />For you Heinz die hard fans out there, this is not the ketchup for you. But for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in Heinz, be sure to give this Ketchup a try.<br /><br />Don't forget the spiced variety. Purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first Sir Kensington experience is definitely the way to go.
