I Was sent 3 week past "Fresh by date" stock. Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste. Won't order again.<br /><br />EDIT: And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it, black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat. unfortunately I put a chip in my mouth before I saw the hole.<br /><br />Very bad form amazon.
