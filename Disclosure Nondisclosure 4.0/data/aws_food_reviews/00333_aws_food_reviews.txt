I found these new spring Pop-Tarts and bought them on a whim.  My kids and I were amazed and delighted at the fun, colorful, amazingly detailed artwork on these Pop-Tarts.  Fantastic for after school snacks, lunch boxes, and school treats. Tie with a ribbon for a bright "thinking of you this spring" gift.  The only challenge is finding more in stores.  Way to go Kellogg's - fantastic product!
