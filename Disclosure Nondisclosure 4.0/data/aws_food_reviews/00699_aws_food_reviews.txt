These chips are delicious. If you like salt & pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch, then you can't go wrong with these--they are the tastiest bag I've come across. The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt, in fact I have trouble cutting myself off mid-bag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet. I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8-9oz bags.
