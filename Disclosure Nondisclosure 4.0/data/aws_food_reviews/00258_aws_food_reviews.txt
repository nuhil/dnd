I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues. It reeks like a chemical rubber smell. This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid. When I called to report the situation to the company, Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab. Unbelievable. Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund, including shipping. The product is faulty. Period. I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership.
