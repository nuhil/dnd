Nothing wrong with the product, but I sure had to mix it with *lots* of other ingredients to make it edible to me. (In Texas I was called a "baby-mouth" - not into very spicy-hot foods.)<br /><br />For comparison, I'm comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa. 1 can of this milder Rotel, mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes, was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips. I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though.
