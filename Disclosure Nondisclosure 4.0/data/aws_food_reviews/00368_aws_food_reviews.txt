Hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school.  He takes two bars now and is very happy to do so.  It is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores.  So again, Amazon.com came through with a reasonable price.  Now, I came keep the husband's breakfast ready as he runs out the door in the mornings.  I often like to have a bar in the evening as a night snack.
