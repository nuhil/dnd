I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting. It arrived fresh and intact. Very good size. I froze half for later use. I am a pastry lover and these were the best I've ever tasted. The pastry was soft, the jam was really good and the taste was great. They were gone in no time. My guests were really impressed.
