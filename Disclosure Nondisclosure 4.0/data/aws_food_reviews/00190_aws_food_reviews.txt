The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright.  Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two, but I probably won't get this again.  There is just a slight "vitaminy" taste, but it's not overwhelming.  It's also a bit pricey for what you get.
