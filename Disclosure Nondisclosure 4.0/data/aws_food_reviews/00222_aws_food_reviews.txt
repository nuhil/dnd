I've tried a variety of Ahmad tea. Not because I particularly like this brand, but they are just easier to come across.  The Imperial blend, I believe, is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones I've tried. It's full body like a good cup of Assam, which by no means overpower the delightful, clean taste of Darjeerling, complete with a long lasting note of bergamot. I enjoy it best in the evening. It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day.<br /><br />For those interested in the specifics: I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug, let it steep in 208F water for 2-3 min, take the infuser out, and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication.
