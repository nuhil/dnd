Well worth the money. I did the calculations on different bags and this dollar amount  is an excellent value. There are approx 2338 pops in the box. So far I've been through about half the box and have found about 3 without wrappers. That's pretty good considering. If you need 30lbs of dum-dums go for this product. Enjoy.
