I'm pleased with these- wasn't sure how they'd be able to replicate the autumn classic flavors of caramel apples, but figured Werther's was a good bet.  I'm diabetic, so wolfing down a real caramel apple when the mood strikes just can't happen as often as I'd like to do so.  But these are tasty enough to get me through until I can 'carb budget'  the real thing. These are made with sugar alcohols, so it's wise to limit how many are eaten in a day unless you're going to be near home and have turbo-flush on your toilet.  (TMI???)  This pack of 6 will last a while, but they're definitely a 'will reorder'.  :)
