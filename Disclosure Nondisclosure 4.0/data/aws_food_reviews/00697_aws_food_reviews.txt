These spicy chips have a lot of great flavor but be warned, you will be left with some stanky breath afterwards! The first time I ate these was at night and then even after brushing and flossing I could taste them in my mouth the next morning. So just be careful about when you eat them, especially if you will be hanging out with people later in the day.
