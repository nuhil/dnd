I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingos.<br /><br />It claims that it is natural. I have no argument on this. But the point is that more than 50% in the bag is over-fried and in brown color. I really suffer eating the over-fried chips. I open some other bags and it looks like the same. So I just throw away all of them. I don't know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same. But for sure I will never buy this brand any more.
