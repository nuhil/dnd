After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5oz bags to arrive, upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse.  Don't know if it is still in the box, but it is outside on the porch.  When my son gets home, I'm going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon.  The outside Amazon box was intact, so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse, don't know which.  I will never buy these again from Amazon.  I cannot tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase.  It makes me sick to think about it!<br /><br />I included pictures at the top of the page.  Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol now.<br /><br />Update:  I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they didn't want them.
