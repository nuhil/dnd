I purchased the Mango flavor, and to me it doesn't take like Mango at all.  There is no hint of sweetness, and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice.  I've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I've tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I've tasted.  It's not terrible, but it's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take.
