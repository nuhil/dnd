These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).
