We can't have any kind of coffee maker at work, so we're forced to buy at the in-house coffee shop or Starbuck's across the street. In this economy, no one wants to pay those high prices, so we started a coffee club. 20 of us buy these coffee bags and separate creamer and enjoy fresh, hot, tasty coffee every day without paying the coffee shop prices. thanks Folgers!!!
