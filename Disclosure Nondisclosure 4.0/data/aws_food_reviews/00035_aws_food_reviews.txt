Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCann's Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann's regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning. This is the best instant brand I've ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety.<br /><br />McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)
