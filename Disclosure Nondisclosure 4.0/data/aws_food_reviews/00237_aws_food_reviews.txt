This is the ultimate puppy food.  The kibbles are great for small breeds.  High in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use.  Less waste results from the high quality ingredients.  I have been hunting, training, showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years, with multiple National Champions.  I have been highly satisfied with Eukanuba's quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods.  My recent purchases are with WAG, through AMAZON.com.  Their prices are the best I have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock.
