The SALSA smelled delicious, as I think it probably was - but, unfortunately, the person, at AMAZON, that is a packer (there is probably several) had very little "stuffing" to work with, especially on the bottoms.  Therefore, the bottoms were broken on all three bottles. As I reached for my computer; I was told NO RETURNS (cause it's a food item).  I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag; and I found "none" on their NEW FACE LIFT.  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT...THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES!  LIKE: I BUY A LOT OF "STUFF" AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES.  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS<br />ESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT.  NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER (FED EX) IS CAREFUL, IT'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.  ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER!  BARBARA L. S.
