WOW!  This product is very impressive. I bought the 8oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging, price and shipping.  The powder dissolves instantly.  Even in water!  I've just been mixing a 1/4 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great!, but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next. This product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries, especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away.  I think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well.  I'm excited to add more of the SuperFoods to my diet in this fast and easy way. I definitely will being trying the other flavors soon.
