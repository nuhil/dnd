I was pleasantly surprised to find this item had been delivered the day after my order, my speediest delivery to date. It probably helps my location is near. Everything looks just as described and pictured and I'm very happy to have done business with this seller. The Gingerbread house was carefully packaged as not to harm the fragile pieces inside. I'm excited to give this item as a gift.
