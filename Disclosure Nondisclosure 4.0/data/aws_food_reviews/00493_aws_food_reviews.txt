A friend of mine brought these into work with the claim , "these will change your life!"  While my life is fairly unchanged, I cannot get enough of these chips . . . . and I do not even like kettle chips.  For the most part, I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy, but the flavor of these chips is amazing!  The are the type of hot that is refreshing.  If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things . . . try these anyway, they may convert you.
