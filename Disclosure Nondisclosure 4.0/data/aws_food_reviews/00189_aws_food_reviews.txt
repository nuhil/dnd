I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants.  I didn't expect it to taste good, but it actually does!  I've only had it for a few days and for $5 its totally worth it.  My sisters all take ganocafe but now I'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee.  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks.  :)
