I was extremely disappionted when I opened my shipment of Enjoy Life On The Go Bars (Very Berry, Carmel Apple, and Cocoa Loco). The boxes are now a plain, generic design..you know, the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper. I then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes I still had at home. Guess what?! Cheaper ingredients! Next, I taste-tested, and let my 3 year old help. He wouldn't eat the new ones...and I can't blame him. They are oily and bland. I thought Enjoy Life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good-tasting product. I was wrong. In summary, these are way too expensive to be made with low-quality, unpalatable ingredients.
