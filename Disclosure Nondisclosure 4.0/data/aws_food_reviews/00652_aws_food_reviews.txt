I'm from Detroit, and I was raised on Vernor's ginger ale.  Once I moved to California, though, I found it difficult to find Vernor's.  It would pop up here and there, and then disappear.  I guess without advertising, it just never found a home.<br /><br />I prefer the plastic bottles, but the ideal size is the 16.9 oz (500 ml) or the one liter.  The problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person (me) too long to drink it, letting it go flat.<br /><br />In any case, Vernor's is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years, I think.  That imparts a great, unique flavor.<br /><br />I wish it would catch on again, and become available more widely.<br /><br />(Recently I did see it on sale in Redwood City in California's Bay Area, south of San Francisco.  The next day, it was gone!
