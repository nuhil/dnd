If you like the Ceylon tea variety, you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea.<br /><br />I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />The current deal for the pack of 4 is very good (cheaper than I can find locally).<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />NOTE: This listing's description is confusing. Each packet of tea weighs 500 grams, which equals 1.1 pounds or 17.6 ounces.
