I loved this mold!  I wished I could have used it for more than one occasion, but it didn't last.  I did use it to make 30+ suckers for my daughter's first birthday. But there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that.  I would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions, but for the price it didn't matter to me that much.  It served it's main purpose :)
