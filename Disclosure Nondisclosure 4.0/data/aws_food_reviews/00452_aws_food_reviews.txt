OK,I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful. I took the plunge as I do like salty, and tangy flavors. No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)
