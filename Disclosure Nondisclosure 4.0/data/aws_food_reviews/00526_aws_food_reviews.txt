It feels strange to review chips, but I am compelled because these are my absolute favorite chips. Kettle has lots of flavors but I always go back to these regular lightly salted.<br /><br />They are thicker and sometimes greasy at the bottom of the bag, plus they often looked burned. They are not actually burned. It has something to do with how much sugar is in the potato that makes it dark. I love to open a bag and find some browned chips.<br /><br />Lays and Wise have their place but I've become a chip snob thanks to Kettle.<br /><br />Like Edy's or Breyer's ice cream, some products are worth the money. These are the best of the best.
