This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so.<br />edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like.<br /><br />I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didn't do a good job focusing on the tuna.<br />I should film it over, but it doesn't look like many people view this product anyway.
