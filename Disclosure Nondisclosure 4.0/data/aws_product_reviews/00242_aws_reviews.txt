I purposely waited almost 4 months before leaving a review. I wanted to see if any issues developed before leaving feedback. I was not disappointed. The refurbished fire arrived in perfect condition, no scratches or wear. I purchased a screen cover immediately to insure it would remain in good shape. After 4 months, it works like a champ. No issues whatsoever. VERY PLEASED and would not hesitate purchasing refurbished item again. Amazon has ALWAYS treated me superbly with any issues I might have with orders or returns.
