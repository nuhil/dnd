Ok first things first, I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap.Now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the Tap was voice enabled like the Echo. I happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. Because the Echo is not meant to be a mobile device. It generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. But the Tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore I am happy it's not a Voice command device. I would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it. So I actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature. I have the Echo on my kitchen counter and the Tap in my Studio office. And when I leave my office I just grab it and go.I bought this on sale for 89 and I went to the store and listened to many Bluetooth speakers. And while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a Bluetooth speaker. While the Tap is so much more for less . And the Tap sounds Great. After looking online I was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but I was 100 wrong about that. There is no other product out there for 89 that sounds this good and can do what the Tap does.I was not paid or given a Tap to write this review. I'm just a consumer who was it the market for a Bluetooth speaker, and I could not be happier with my choice.Also if you buy this device buy the Amazon sling as well. Trust me you will want it. And honestly I am again happy I got the one that covers the bottom of the Tap. Because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink I would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed.That's it, that's all. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!
