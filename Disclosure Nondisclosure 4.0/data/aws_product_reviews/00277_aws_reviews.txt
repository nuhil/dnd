I was so shocked! So, I was going through a book for my PhD dissertation, highlighting parts for further citations in my project. When I was done with it, I realised that instead of scrolling back all the pages of my e-book, looking for the highlights, I can just export them to my e-mail in PDF file. This is life changing for me! I have always preferred paper books to e-books, but this option is a miracle. It saved me hours of work! I am a very happy customer!
