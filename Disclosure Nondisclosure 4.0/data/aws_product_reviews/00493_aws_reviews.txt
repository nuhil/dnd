This works as a case, and matches the color of the kindle nicely. The main feature I wanted was the stand, however. It is only one corner flap, as pictured. I incorrectly assumed there might be slightly more technology involved. There is no stop or anything to keep it from going completely flat backward. Starting out, my kindle would sit at a nice 70 degree or so angle from the table, but now my kindle will sit at maybe 30 degrees off the table. Eventually it will just go flat. I've had it for maybe 3 weeks. If the stand feature is important to you, get a different case.
