First, let me say that this is my first Fire tablet. I've previously had either iPad's or Android tablets. I was skeptical at first because I've generally only liked iPad's, but I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. I paid full price for this product and am not being compensated in any manner to post this review.Let's just jump right to the Pro's and Con's shall wePro's:FastAmazing Screen resolutionGreat soundResponsiveAlexa is kind of awesomeBattery life. OMG! I've charged it once so far, I've watched YouTube videos on it, streamed a movie and a few TV shows and I use it for Facebook and I'm not even half way down on the battery after 3 days. Wow!The OS. The operating system is simple, responsive, and beautifully done. Everything is easy to find and it's really easy to navigate.Con's:Only one Con...Charge port. The charge port is sticky and doesn't seem as high quality.Overall this is a fantastic tablet and worth so much more than the price. I LOVE IT!
