Was excited to get this product for its sheer portability alone (doesn't need to be plugged into an electrical outlet all the time like we have to do with our Echo Dot), but was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and volume! We prefer this over our outdoor bluetooth speaker, and its "Hands-Free" mode is a great updated feature (though we try not to keep it on that setting too long because it does drain the battery faster)...
