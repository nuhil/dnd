I'm totally enjoying my Echo Dot! I have it synced to my Google Calendar and am able to let Alexa tell me what's on the agenda for the day. I can quickly ask her to set a timer or an alarm and easily find out about the local weather. I also have it synced to my Pandora account but you have to be specific about a saved station name when you want to listen to Pandora. I really wish I could just say shuffle my Pandora stations. That would be awesome! The speaker on the Dot isn't as loud as I would like it but if I'm sitting close by, it's good enough I guess. I've seen an option to add an external speaker but I haven't gotten around to doing that yet. And my 6 yo grandson loves to ask her to tell him a joke! I live in a small town and am probably not able to utilize the full potential of Alexa but I'm not regretting my purchase.
