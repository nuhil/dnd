What a DEAL............ I got this great tablet for a great price on Prime Day..... but was a little concerned it would be too big..to handle. but I was wrong.First I I was very surprised.. by several things about the Fire 10 that made me SMILE:......1) even though it is large in size the weight is LIGHT so it is much easier to handle than expected ( esp since my fire HD 8.9 HEAVY unit )).......2.) it does several things I wasn't expecting.. One is it has SCREEN MIRRORING... that means you can see your tablets screen on you great BIG TV screen. if you choose for games or what ever. 3. ) Smooth and FAST .. due to the nice processor.......4. ) WHOO HOO.. Google Play store can be easily added without disrupting you Amazon experience ( look it up on youtube))( it took less than 4 minutes and it was Up and RUNNING ))....... 5.) I think the Screen is Beautiful............ ( cannot imagine what others are seeing but this screen looks Great to me) 6.) FINALLY they put the speakers in the FRONT so it is much easier to hear you shows or music etc 7.) I think this is My FAV............I put in a great big 125g sd card and I am loaded to download anything I choose... loads of Movie from the A Amazon Prime Movies,..................ALL of my audio books from Audible.................and a huge amt of my Kindle Books...........I am delighted....... and should get several years out of this tablet in its present format..........ESP. now that google PLAY STORE is on it .Happy Happy Happy......
