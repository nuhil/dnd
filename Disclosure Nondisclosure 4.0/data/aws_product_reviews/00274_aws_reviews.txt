If you read the KNOW WHAT YOU ARE BUYING review for the Kindle prior to this one then you know where I am going. Already this new Kindle is riddled with one star reviews from people that seem to not have read the product description. Here goes:*THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!*THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE GAMING CAPABILITY!*THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE PAGE TURNING BUTTONS!Like a regular book you just might HAVE A HARD TIME READING THIS KINDLE IN BED AT NIGHT WITH LOW LIGHTING!What you will get though is an awesome entry level Kindle with software almost identical to the higher end models. The print looks flawless outside, by a window, or under a lamp, in other words, just like a real book.
