This is a great controller for our Fire TV, I purchased 2 of them, with two problems but let me first talk about the good. The controller works well for most of the games we play on the Fire TV. It has a long range compared to other controllers Ive tried (solid at 30 feet) and uses WiFi Direct instead of Bluetooth. The feel of it is decent (not too rubbery) and none of the buttons, D-Pad, or sticks have stuck or given us a problem. The microphone on it works as good or better than the one on the Fire TV remote.Now on to the problems. Its such an issue that Im not just putting it in the cons section but am going to tell you a bit about it. The worst problem is the battery life! In fact, its such a huge problem that Im taking off 2 stars because of it. This controller eats batteries like nobodys business. I have tried regular AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), expensive AA batteries (both Duracell and Energizer), and rechargeable AA batteries (Ive tried Energizer, Apple, AmazonBasics). The controller doesnt drain the batteries completely, nope. That I would understand. Instead, the controller stops working after only a 40 drain. I kid you not. Every set of batteries I have put into this thing has stopped working when there is still 60 battery life left. I have tested each set, before and after, using a generic battery tester as well as an ohm meter.The second problem may not be the controller itself, it may be the Fire TV, but its affecting the controller. The controller randomly disconnects. Not often enough for it to be a huge issue but just enough for it to be annoying. I have seen reports of others having the same problem with the controller and the remote. Im hoping that this issue will be fixed with a firmware update.Read more
