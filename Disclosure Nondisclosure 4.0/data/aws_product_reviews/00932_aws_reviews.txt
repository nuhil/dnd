A friend gave me a Dot, which I enjoyed. I decided to explore the other devices. I was torn between the Echo and the Tap. After reading a CNET review, I chose the Tap because it is portable. My two frustrations are you cannot change the wake up word "Alexis", and you have to be exact in your language when requesting a service. If you are Amazon prime or Audible book member, it is a great addition to you household.
