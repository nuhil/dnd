Great toyreal tablet. It is basically a real Fire 7 tablet, with kid's built-in entertainment center. There are 2 modes here: Parent (admin) and Kids (one or multiple accounts). When in Parent mode (password protected), the Fire 7 looks and feels just like an Android tablet with all of the Fire 7 functionality (Facebook, Netflix, Books, blah, blah), so all of us Android users feel right at home. In the Parent mode you can also manage kids accounts: how much they can use the tablet per day, what they can and cannot watch/play, manage their installed apps, ect. When in kid's mode, the tablet behaves just like it is on the pictures, easy-to-use, colorful interface. You need to click switch user to switch from Parent to Kids accounts.Some confusion here I got from reading other reviews- the kids apps are not pre-installed the main interface is an app store, just like Google Play, ect. The apps here are unique to this Kids Account, and are all free with the included subscription which includes don't know how many games, Amazon Videos, reading and audio books. You still have to download each app before using it, so make sure to stock up on apps before going on a road trip.
