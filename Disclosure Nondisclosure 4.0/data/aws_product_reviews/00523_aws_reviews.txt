I have purchased several Amazon Fire cases in the past and have been delighted in the streamlined design and the vinyl covering. Very easy to keep clean. This new design for the fire HD 8 is FABRIC. How long do you imagine a yellow fabric cover is going to stay clean I cannot see any easy way to clean it, like I do with the vinyl covers. I bought one for myself as well as my Mother. I will keep them but I sure hope they don't turn around and produce vinyl ones after all the concerns I am sure will be coming. I won't be able to afford two more.
