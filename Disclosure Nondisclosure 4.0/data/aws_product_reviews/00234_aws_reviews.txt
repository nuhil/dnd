The Amazon Echo Show is a voice-activated device. You can instruct it to play video content, play music, stream online audio, order products and services, and control home automation products. The Echo Show is the first device of its kind to feature its own screen, which in my opinion, greatly enhances the use and potential of this device.Ive been using this device for a few days so far. Below you will find some of my initial impressions: What I Like Good build quality: The Show has a nice, bright screen that has good viewing angles.Good sound: The speakers on the Show sound much better than the original echo.Easy setup: Setup was extremely easy, mostly due to the Shows touch screen. After making a few selections, the Show was up and running in no time.Content suggestions: When you aren't interacting with the Show, it continuously displays content suggestions. I like that it will suggest videos to watch.Video content: I like being able to view Amazon Video, video news briefings, movie trailers, and YouTube videos on the Show.Video calling: Video calling works as advertised. I like being able to initiate a call with my voice.Music with lyrics: When playing songs from Amazon Music, you can see album art and song lyrics on the screen.Home automation: Like other Echos, the Show can control your smart home products. The show has the extra ability to display camera feeds.On-screen apps: The echo can display my calendar, reminders, lists, timers, local weather, and more. Because of this, I find the Show infinitely more useful than the original Echo. What I Don't Like The Show needs more functionality that leverages the touch screen.Read more
