I own a roku and apple tv and have to say that the Amazon Fire TV falls into more of the apple tv category. It's definitely a walled garden of content that feeds you into amazon's prime tv offerings. You can access a lot of titles there for pay and often less expensively than On Demand options available from your cable provider.However, for your prime investment, there are no free titles. I'd love to see Amazon take a netflix model for a certain number of older titles. The price barrier keeps me from watching older titles, but the prices of latest releases are about average and worth it.The interface is great. I find the voice activation to be really accurate and easy to use. It's really how you are meant to navigate the massive number of options available.Performance is best in class as the Fire TV has a quad core processor that is unmatched by any other provider. I'd love to see a great game title arrive on the box that would make the game controller worth the investment. However, for an all-in-one, solution the game selection can definitely hit the spot.I use the plex and netflix apps available for this device and they perform great. Certainly, there's no blu-ray player that can match the capability of this device.All-in-all I definitely recommend this device to anyone, but still prefer the Roku since Roku isn't selling its own content service, so it agnostically serves a lot of free content that you didn't even know existed.
