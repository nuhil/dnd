I previously owned an Asus infinity with 10 inch screen until it died on vacation and I grabbed the smaller 8 gb fire during the one day sale. I could not get used to the small screen or lack of storage so here I am with the new 10 inch fire. If you liked your fire 7 you will love this. The 32 gb is sufficient itself for downloading tons of books, music, and a couple of movies and games but when you pair that with the ability at last to use a memory card (and it's about time Amazon makes a version that can do this) the storage is enough for even most power users! Set up is a breeze just follow the onscreen instructions. Within minutes out of the box I was surfing the web, checking my email and posting on Facebook. After charging the battery to full I streamed a one hour tv show from Netflix and when I checked afterwards the battery was still at 95 percent. I am writing this review on it right now. If you have prime you can download a movie to watch later without needing your wifi which is a big plus for me as we are in storm season here so when the power goes out I can at least watch a movie.
