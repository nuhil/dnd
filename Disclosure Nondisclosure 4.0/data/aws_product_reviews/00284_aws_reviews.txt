This was a birthday gift from my daughter. (71st birthday--certified old guy) What might I do with an Echo I bought a 3 Kindle book on using an Echo. Later I discovered most of what is in the book is probably in the on board helps, but the book makes a nice linear presentation that does not make me guess what I need to search out, and a Kindle book makes it easy for me to make notes I can find later with ease.I am using my Echo primarily as a radio. In the early 1990s I worked on my German skills by listening to a lot of shortwave radio. Most of that is now on the Internet. I could listen on my smart phone, but that uses phone battery reserves. The Echo runs on AC power from a wall outlet. The little speaker is adequate for voice broadcasts. I listen for hours to German news magazines. I can also listen to some old favorite broadcasts from Radio Canada.We live where my favorite talk radio program comes in poorly due to another station very near on the dial. But, our WiFi reaches my garage workshop and I have clear audio through Tune In. (I am having trouble linking iHeart Radio, perhaps because my subscription is not paid.)When I have asked Alexa a question she sometimes tells me she cannot answer a question I thought simple enough.I did ask for some music and was surprised to find CDs I bought as gifts are in Amazon's cloud for me to hear over Echo. Nice!
