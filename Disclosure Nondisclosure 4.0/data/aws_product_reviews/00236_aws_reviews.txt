I've only had my Echo Show just a little over 24 hours now, so please take that into consideration. I currently own the original echo which is in my living room, a dot in my bedroom, and one at work. I have lights, fans, a thermostat, surround sound, and tv all connected to my Alexa devices. Of course I had to buy one with a screen.Initially I wanted to put my show on a 70 inch TV stand by my 60 inch TV. I don't have end tables and quickly came to the realization that a viewing a 7 inch screen from 8 feet away wasn't going to work for me. My Show now sits on my kitchen counter. I figured I'd get more use out of it in my living room because I generally spend more time in their than the kitchen.The problem with displaying the show on a kichen counter is that the screen can only be seen from straight on, so if you aren't standing directly in front of it, it's hard to view the screen. You will have to turn it in a dirction that it would be facing you.As far as I can tell you can not cut the screen off completely, which would make this a bad fit for a bedroom. The clock displays in white with the screen in a dim black by using the command turn off the screen.This device was marketed as a hands free companion in the kitchen for things like recipes. My frustration is when I ask it to pull up a recipe it's inconsistent. Sometimes it wants to send the recipe to my phone, sometimes it wants me to swipe down on the screen to access the cooking directions and ingredients. Why can't I just say Alexa scroll down Why do I have to touch the screen Why does it have to send the recipe to my phone for me to view it when the Show already has a screenI was hoping for more video footage with my daily briefings, but it is very limited.Read more
