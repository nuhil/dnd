First I would like to say that I am coming from using Google TV. Fire TV is a great device. The voice search is accurate at picking up what I say. My biggest problem with this device is also with the voice search. Coming from Google TV if you used the search feature if would look for it in more places. Lets say I am searching for the movie Gremlins. On Google TV it would look for it in Netflix, Amazon Instant, instant prime, Google play store, HBO Go, and you get the idea. This device for example will not check Netflix. So I must do a voice search to see if it is on Amazon, if not I must open lets say Netflix and use the up, down, left, right buttons and manually enter the letter to find out if it is on Netflix. That was the big issue for me. A small issue is the amount of apps. No HBO Go, Google play store, and others. I am not blaming amazon for this. It is an open system so HBO and others just need to make the apps for it. This devise is quick, and amazon items start up instantly, but not Netflix. Netflix must load first, but that is not a big deal. If you are wondering why I am switching from Google TV, it is because Google neglected it and it hasn't received updates in a long time. I think Google gave up on it.
