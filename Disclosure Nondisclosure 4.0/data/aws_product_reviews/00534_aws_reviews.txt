In this day and age of rectangles with screens being covered in various ways, its perplexing that you can mess up something as basic as this. It covers the Fire fine. The fit is snug and snaps into place no problem. A hidden magnet auto-wakes/sleeps the display when you open/close it. The fabric collects cat hair like a pair of cheap black pants. Yet worst of all is the fold on the back does an awful job of propping up fire when you want to use it hands free. You can get it to stay, but it often slides out, or just puts the fire at a slightly weird angle. Whether it's in portrait or landscape orientation, the stand on the back is so wonky, that you're better off just using a jar of peanut butter and a couple pieces of chewing gum to get it to stay in place.
