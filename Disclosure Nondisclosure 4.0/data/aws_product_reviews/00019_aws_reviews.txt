Only 4 stars because I found it very confusing at first. I had a Kindle before found it very easy to find what I needed to do. The user guide didn't really answer my questions, but I persisted am getting used to it. I really love the backlit screen no buttons to push to change pages. At first I wasn't sure about the smaller screen, but didn't take long to get over that. I'm sure I'm just a creature of habit not very techy. All in all, the Kindle Paperwhite is great.
