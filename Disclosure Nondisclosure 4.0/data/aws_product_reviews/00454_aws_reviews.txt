According to the info, the Paperwhite charges faster with the charger made for a Kindle but I think any brand will work. It came in a package deal when I bought my Paperwhite otherwise I would've skipped it used what I've been using for my old Kindle. I gave it 4 stars, because I like it, but feel it's overpriced.
