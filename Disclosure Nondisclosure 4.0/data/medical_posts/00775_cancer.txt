Hi. My mom is 69. She has had Polycythemia Vera for more than 10 years, and Crohn's disease for around the same. She's got other things-asthma, t2 diabetes, kyphosis, osteoporosis, but the top 2 or the toughest on her and most life threatening, I think. Last few weeks she's swollen up so large in abdomen she looks 9 months pregnant and tummy feels just as hard. Extreme pain in ribs, stomach, sometimes more in upper right quadrant, back, shoulders. CT scan showed she's filled with ascites. Today she had a paracentesis to relieve the pain and shortness of breath, and to diagnose the fluid. Dr seemed to be leaning towards stomach malignancy yesterday, but no definitive answers yet... However, the paracentesis wasn't able to remove much fluid at all-thick and urine colored .. They didn't know why.. She's still in a lot of pain and just as distended as before... They also gave her a sonogram. I have read that rarely Budd-chiari syndrome has same symptoms and is linked to Polycythemia... Didn't know if that would have shown up in CT scan.... Also known that Crohn's can turn into colorectal cancer, and spread. I've read that ascites is not usually something that happens right away.. Usually more of a late stage thing, for whatever it ends up being. Sorry this is so long - so my questions are: 1) is this story familiar to anyone, and if so, please share. 2) Any ideas on why they couldn't remove much? Does the thickness or color tell us anything? 3)She is in so much pain.... Any home remedies for the rib pain the ascites is causing? Couldn't give ibuprofen because of the blood thinning property and her just getting the paracentesis... I gave her Tylenol. Does heating pad help or hurt? Ice? Thanks for any advice, info, or words.
