My brother has been having a really hard time recently. He's been going to two different doctor to figure out what is wrong with him but neither one know for sure. One claims that he has Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma, then backtracks. The other does the same. This is what we know:
 1. He has lost a tremendous amount of weight this past year.
 2. He can't gain the weight back no matter what his diet. He's eaten all sorts of fatty foods including KFC 5 times per week, candy, Popsicles, etc..
 3. He's contracted Jr. onset diabetes from this illness and has to check his blood sugar frequently.
 4. Doctor's found 6 masses in his stomach but, according to him, they said they aren't large enough to be causing the problem. He has also said that they aren't sure if they are malignant or benign even after biopsy.
 Doctors have told him that if his weight drops below 130lbs, he will have to be admitted to the hospital. He is afraid that he won't be around in 6 months.
 Any ideas to point the Doctors in the right direction?
