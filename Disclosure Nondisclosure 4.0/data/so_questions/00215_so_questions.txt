<p>I have a Java swing application with a panel that contains three JComboBoxes that do not draw properly.<br>
The combox boxes just show up as the down arrow on the right side, but without the label of the currently selected value.<br>
The boxes will redraw correctly if the window is resized either bigger or smaller by even one pixel.</p>

<p>All of my googling has pointed to calling revalidate() on the JPanel to fix this, but that hasn't worked for me.<br>
Calling updateUI() on the JPanel has changed it from always displaying incorrectly to displaying incorrectly half of the time.  </p>

<p>Has anyone else seen this and found a different way to force a redraw of the combo boxes?</p>
