<p>I'm creating an ZIP file with ZipFile in Python 2.5, it works ok so far:</p>

<pre><code>import zipfile, os

locfile = "test.txt"
loczip = os.path.splitext (locfile)[0] + ".zip"
zip = zipfile.ZipFile (loczip, "w")
zip.write (locfile)
zip.close()
</code></pre>

<p>but I couldn't find how to encrypt the files in the ZIP file.
I could use system and call PKZIP -s, but I suppose there must be a more "Pythonic" way.  I'm looking for an open source solution.</p>
