<p>I've been trying to wrap my head around how threads work in Python, and it's hard to find good information on how they operate. I may just be missing a link or something, but it seems like the official documentation isn't very thorough on the subject, and I haven't been able to find a good write-up.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, only one thread can be running at once, and the active thread switches every 10 instructions or so?</p>

<p>Where is there a good explanation, or can you provide one? It would also be very nice to be aware of common problems that you run into while using threads with Python.</p>
