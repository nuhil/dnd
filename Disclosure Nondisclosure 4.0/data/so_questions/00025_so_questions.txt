<p>I currently use a DataTable to get results from a database which I can use in my code.</p>

<p>However, many example on the web show using a DataSet instead and accessing the table(s) through the collections method.</p>

<p>Is there any advantage, performance wise or otherwise, of using DataSets or DataTables as a storage method for SQL results?</p>
