Royal Canin was recommended for my dog, but since this line of dog food is specific to breed, it was difficult to find in stores.  PetsMart and Petco carried the Cocker Spaniel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio.  Finding a larger bag has been a great deal.  My cocker loves the food too!
