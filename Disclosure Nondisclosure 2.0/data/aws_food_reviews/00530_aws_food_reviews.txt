Someone brought these to a party we had last month and I didn't put them out because the buffet was full and didn't think anyone would like saltless potato chips.  Last week we had some friends over and these were all I had in the pantry so I put them out.  OH MY GOSH THEY ARE SO GOOD!  I was so wrong to think they would be bland; they are full of real potato flavor, wonderfully crisp and very fresh tasting.  I am here on amazon to buy a case, I only want to have these with dips.  Truly delicious!
