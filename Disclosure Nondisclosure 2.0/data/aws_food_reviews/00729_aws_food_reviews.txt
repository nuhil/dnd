So surprised to find the Taiwan-shaped pineapple cakes, they are so cute!<br />I've never found any pineapple cake like this at our local Asian supermarkets, so I ordered some from here. These lovely pastries made our Dragon Boat Festival party much more fun. My friends and I think it is a good idea to  order them again for our Mid-Autumn Festival party.
