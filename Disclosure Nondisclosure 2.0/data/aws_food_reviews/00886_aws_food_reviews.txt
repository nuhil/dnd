This brand of granola bars are really good.  The very berry are my favorite.  However, the bars are almost ridiculously small.  Yeah, we're gluten free, so our food is a lot more dense than other food, but honestly, can we not have normal sized, good tasting granola bars?  They really are tiny.  So, the taste is GREAT but the bar is small.
