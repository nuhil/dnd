The BEST investment I've ever made for ginger. It's unbelievable! It's fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it's perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  It's very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I'll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)
