I recently purchased this on sale at my local grocery store... now I know why it was on sale!<br /><br />This is not a fluffy, creamy white frosting you'd expect to find when opening the jar. Now, I wasn't expecting it to be just like Betty Crocker, but it was pretty bad. Like others said, it is a gluey/tacky mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on.  It reminds me of taffy that hasn't quite hit the right stage in the candy making process.  The taste isn't that great either, and it's sickeningly sweet (even for frosting).  The only thing it might be used for is a frosting for cinnamon buns?  I still don't think it would be the right consistency...
