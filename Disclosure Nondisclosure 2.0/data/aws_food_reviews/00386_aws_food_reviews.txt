The cashews were nice and big, with the vast majority being whole.  There were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag, but that's pretty expected with so many cashews.  They made an absolutely excellent cashew brittle.<br /><br />My order took just over a week to arrive, which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country.  They came double bagged in clear plastic bags, and in two 5 lb portions.  This was highly convenient since I could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until I was ready to work with it.<br /><br />Great value for the price.
