Fantastic tasting potato chips. I love the individual bags, great for kids and adults too. No trans fat, no cholesterol, no artifical stuff.<br />Low in sodium and high in potassium, which is great for people like me with HBP.<br />Only problem is Amazon is out of stock some times and price is high.
