I WAS VISITING MY FRIEND NATE THE OTHER MORNING FOR COFFEE , HE CAME OUT OF HIS STORAGE ROOM WITH ( A PACKET OF McCANNS INSTANT IRISH OATMEAL .) HE SUGGESTED THAT I TRY IT FOR MY OWN USE ,IN MY STASH . SOMETIMES NATE DOSE NOT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO SAY NO , SO I ENDED UP TRYING THE APPLE AND CINN . FOUND IT TO BE VERY TASTEFULL WHEN MADE WITH WATER OR POWDERED MILK . IT GOES GOOD WITH O.J. AND COFFEE AND A SLICE OF TOAST AND YOUR READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLD...OR THE DAY AT LEAST..  JERRY REITH...
