Great chips, great price.  Odds are that you will have them to yourself.  If you like your fish and chips soaked in malt vinegar, you will love these.  The best salt and vinegar chips I have ever had (and I love this flavor, mind you).  They are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own.  Since I have found that S&V is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species I know that my afternoon snack is all mine, unless of course I run into another heavy brained, hearty breathed like mind.  -Summary- If you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wont pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels.  It is the first and only time I have committed to a whole case of chips and I will do it again.  Mmmmm... vinegar...
