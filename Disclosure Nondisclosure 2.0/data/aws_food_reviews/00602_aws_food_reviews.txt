Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I've tasted thus far. They are thick, has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors. My favorite Kettle chip happens to be the honey Dijon. I think it's a great combination sweet, salty and tangy, perfect for one of those snack attacks when you don't know exactly what you want. I especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch. These 2-oz bags are perfect for anyone who has a problem controlling portions (like me!).
