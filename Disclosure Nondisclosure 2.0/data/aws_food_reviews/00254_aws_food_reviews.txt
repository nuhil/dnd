I am chemical sensitive as well as sugar-free. I have been using this product for over a year. I use it maybe once a week at the most. I drink 1/2 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how I feel. IMO this doesn't replace my a.m. coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when I start to fade. Once in a while I drink a full bottle before a workout. I've been drinking Guayaki Yerba Mate teas for years. Compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there I highly recommend this. This product is clean and doesn't leave nasty chems behind in the body. Try it before you judge from a review - everyone's body reacts differently.
