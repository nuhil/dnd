Can't say anything bad about Sugar in the Raw.  I like it better than the other "natural" sugars. Better consistency and - I know it doesn't matter - but better color. Unfortunately, one of the "natural" paper bags got torn a bit in the box.  It didn't look like the box was damaged so I can't tell how it happened, but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it.  Not sure what the solution is and I'd order it again, but if it happens again, I'd switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag.
