This brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time -- I've believe the company is local.  I've been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it.  I'm particularly fond of the Turtle Sundae but all the flavors are good.  I can't say that I've had a bad one.<br /><br />As it turns out, it's less expensive to order it from Amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local Walmart to get it.  It's a no brainer.  Try it, if you like rich, flavored coffee, you'll like it.
