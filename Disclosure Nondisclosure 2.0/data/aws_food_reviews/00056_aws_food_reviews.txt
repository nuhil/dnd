We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill (about 1/3 of the bag at a time).  The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too.  More importantly, the coffee is smooth; no bitter aftertaste.  On numerous occasions, we've had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much.
