I opened the can and immediately became concerned when I saw what looked like dried white crust, rather than fluffy frosting.  The package recommended stirring before use, so I gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo.  The best I can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in "Better of Dead" (no raisins in it though!).<br />I tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it.  When lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knife.<br />I opted for making my own frosting instead - very easy!  A little Sprectrum palm shortening, a lot of powdered sugar, a tiny splash of vanilla, a tiny bit of salt, and rice milk as needed for consistency, beat for 5 minutes, and I had the fluffy 'butter' cream frosting I thought I'd get from Cherrybrook.<br /><br />I wonder if our can was overheated in the store (whole foods) or something...<br />I've read positive reviews of their frosting mix, so maybe I'll try that next time.
