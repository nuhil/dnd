I love the aroma and the taste of the fruit and vanilla combo, and the addition of ginseng for an added energy boost rounds this tea out nicely for me. It's a sweet tea, which makes it a wonderful healthy alternative to desert after dinner.<br /><br />I see that others didn't like it, but it's really a matter of personal taste...different courses for different horses!
