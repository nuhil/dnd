My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food. She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has. After we got the test back, we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand. So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this! She still has her environmental triggers, but I am happy she can finally eat something I know won't cause her pain.
