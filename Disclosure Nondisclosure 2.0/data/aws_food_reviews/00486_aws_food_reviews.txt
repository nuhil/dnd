My husband likes these a lot. They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however.
