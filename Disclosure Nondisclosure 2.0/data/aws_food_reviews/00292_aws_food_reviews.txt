If you want an organic energy shot, your choices are this one from Steaz and the assorted flavors from Guayaki. Guayaki Yerba Mate is actually in the Steaz energy shot and energy drinks, and they both use Sambazon Acai, so there are some similarities in ingredients.<br /><br />Great energy burst for 4+ hours on a Steaz Energy Shot, and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards. Plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work. This will help me cut down on my iced coffees, which are not helping my calorie intake.<br /><br />Already ordering 12-packs on subscribe and save, 2 per month. Great value.
