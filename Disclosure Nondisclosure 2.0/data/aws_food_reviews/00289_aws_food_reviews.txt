I have to get up really early to work out before work and I get super tired by the middle of the afternoon. I was drinking one 5 hour energy, usually extra strength, each day. It worked well, but gave me a jittery feeling, almost headachy but not quite. My husband got me to try this and I was skeptical, but for me it works as well if not better than the 5 hour energy and doesn't give me that jittery almost-headache feeling.<br /><br />I don't mind the taste--it reminds me of the inside of a fig newton (mmm). And the price is ok, on Amazon anyway. At my grocery store they were almost $3 each, yike!<br /><br />And it's organic--so I can feel good about it, right? It's all about me feeling good!
