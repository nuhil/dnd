Seriously, now. Tasty, tasty, tasty. Fresh, too!<br /><br />The only problem is that you have a pack of 24 and that can lend itself to wanting to make multiple trips to the cupboard for more helpings! Or, grabbing multiple bags to begin with. Pace yourself! I keep saying.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with these if you're a fan of the salt and vinegar classic flavor.<br /><br />2-ounce bags are about double the size of the kid's bags; about the same size as the ones in the small gas station racks. It's really a good size for an adult.<br /><br />It's a somewhat healthier snack than a typical bag of fried chips, but it has 300 calories per bag. Again, not too bad, but something to think about.<br /><br />Bottom-line: Delicious!
