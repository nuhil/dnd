I am so glad I was introduced the this brand of sweetner to replace sugar, this is so much better. I really like how it sweetens my herbal sweet teas without having to use too much, and how it can be used in place of pancake syrup too. Learning how to use it what the first thing I had to learn, once I learned how to use it, I became hooked. I would not even look at sugar any more. I highly reccomend if you want a clean fresh taste and feel to your foods.If you do purchase this sweetner, take advantage of ship and save, it will save you lots of money in the long run.
