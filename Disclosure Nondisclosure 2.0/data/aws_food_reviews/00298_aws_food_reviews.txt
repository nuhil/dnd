I've tried 5-hour energy, red rain, NOS, and other energy shots.  This is my favorite in terms of taste and effect.  Plus, it's somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used.  Sometimes I wonder what I'm really putting into my body with some of the other brands.  I purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years.
