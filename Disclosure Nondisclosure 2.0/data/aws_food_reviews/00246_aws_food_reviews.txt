I've been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years, usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas, where many Middle-Eastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas, usually at $5-7 for a pound box.  I've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea, with enough aroma and taste, and beautiful reddish color, perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own, but a decent base for mixes.<br />This tea, however, is nothing of the sort. Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell, and the brewed tea is weak, flat and tasteless.  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore. So, you get a lot of tea for the money, but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags, they are not that much worse.
