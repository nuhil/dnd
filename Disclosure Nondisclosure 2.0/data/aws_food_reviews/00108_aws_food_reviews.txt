I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite. Hence, when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out.  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market. They are fantastic, and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. I'm going to order the six pack and I'm a household of one. They wont go to waste!
