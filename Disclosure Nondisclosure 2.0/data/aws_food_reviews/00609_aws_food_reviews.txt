This bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool, such as scissors, don't even try without scissors.<br /><br />They are crispy and taste like chips that aren't advertised as being salted. They definitely aren't healthy, because I can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them, and I can see the grease at the bottom of the bag, too.<br /><br />They are high-quality chips, and deserve to be put on your table.
