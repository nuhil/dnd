I have recently stopped eating a number of allergens (dairy, soy, nuts) and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions.  Unfortunately, these were pretty gross - miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry.  I threw them away.  I would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free.
