I paid $1.79 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today. I bought them because brown rice is a "good" carb.  As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients.  The name is deceptive - these have "Masa corn flour" listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste.  I won't buy these again - I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste.
