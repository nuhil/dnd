These are among the best chips I have ever eaten!  I first came upon them when I visited a CostPlus World Market store in Opelika, AL, in the Tiger Town Mall, in 2007.  I wasn't a big fan of dijon-flavored anything, but I decided to give these chips a try.  I was hooked.  I probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months' time.  I searched all over my part of Alabama (the northwestern part of the state) and could not find them.  I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover, at the Patton Creek Shopping Center, and they did not carry this flavor.  However, when I learned that they were available on Amazon.com, and also available for PRIME Shipping - I bought them as soon as I read "Kettle Chips Honey Dijon, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)!"<br /><br />You get a pretty big box, filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels.  They last quite a while, but I will re-order, very, very soon!  I suggest you buy them, in this bulk form, and enjoy them - you won't be disappointed!  They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs - so they're perfect for spring and this coming summer's outdoor activities and cook-outs!<br /><br />Take my word for it, these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods!  Buy some today, and fall in love like me!
