I was looking for a natural energy shot that works, and I found it. Steaz energy shot is my favorite!<br /><br />I recently had gastric bypass surgery, so tons of sugar is a no-no. And I'm also allergic to Sucralose (Splenda) so most other energy drinks are out.<br /><br />I tried Bazi energy shots and they didn't work as well as Steaz, and definitely didn't taste as well. These have a taste that's almost like Coca-Cola--not bad at all.<br /><br />If you're looking for natural energy, give these a try.
