Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label "yeast extract".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore.
