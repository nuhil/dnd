Imagine taking some kids' playground chalk, perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks. Then scoop it up and put it in your mouth.<br /><br />That's how disgusting this bar is.<br /><br />I have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful, IT HAS NONE. I've done nutritional coaching for 30 years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellent.<br /><br />This neanderthal-era gluten free bar is so bad I want to go to my local grocery store, take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store (perhaps, if there's a trash compactor?) just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product.<br /><br />Save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else.<br /><br />"Enjoy Life" bars? Being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth.
