I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.
