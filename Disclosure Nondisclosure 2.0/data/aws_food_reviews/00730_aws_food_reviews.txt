I really like the pineapple shortcakes sold here. Unlike some of the mass-production pineapple shortcakes that use artificial flavoring, Tasselfield's pineapple shortcakes use real pineapples and it makes the whole world difference. You can even taste the fibers from pineapple.<br /><br />I opted for the traditional pineapple this time. I will be interested in trying out the Longan or mango variety next time.
