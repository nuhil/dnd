I love this sea salt & vinegar flavor from Kettle.  When I saw this one on the daily deal here for $17.99/case, I put my order without doubt.  However, when I received the case, I found out that the whole case is expiring in December while I got it at the end of August.  I tried one package and I can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips.  I was disappointed and then I found out this item is not returnable!  How convenient!  Although I love this chips, I won't order from here again with the concern of close expiration date...
