The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed "ginger with attitude" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  "Great Taste Naturally" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!
