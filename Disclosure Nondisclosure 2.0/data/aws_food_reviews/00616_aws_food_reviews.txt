These are my new favorite!  I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one!  They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.<br /><br />Price wise...I do not see that they are that much of a deal here.  I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping.  I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price.  The taste is fabulous -- you won't be disappointed.
