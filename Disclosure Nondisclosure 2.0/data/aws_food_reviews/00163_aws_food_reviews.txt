I'm not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict, gave this a shot. The tuna tastes like it's good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland. It's better than something plain but it didn't pack the punch I was hoping for. It's still a great option for a low calorie, low fat meal.
