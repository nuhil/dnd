This tea carries the flavor one would expect from the smell: terrible.  It invigorates like a puncture wound, and the only revival is that, after drinking, you discover that you are still alive.<br /><br />Well, one tea bag was enough for me.  My mother-in-law said, "Oh, that smells kind of like wine."  Okay, kind of like wine, with a hint of rot and a moldy aftertaste.  If she likes it, she can have the whole box.
