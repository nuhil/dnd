I was first introduced to the Red Rice & Beans chips in my hometown of Bethlehem, PA.  When I moved to North Carolina I was unable to find these chips in my local area.  On my trips back home, I would buy a bunch of bags to bring back with me to NC.  Then I discovered that I could order them on-line and life was great.  These chips are my all time favorite and everyone that I serve them to loves them just the same.  You just gotta try them ... you'll be hooked !!!  ..... Nancy Walsh
