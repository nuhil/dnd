This is pretty good canned meat. The sausage I used in dirty rice, the hamburger I used for taco salad, the chicken with wild rice, and the pork with stuffing. the turkey I gave to a neighbor because I don't eat it. The various meats are all pretty good quality and was enough for 3 large portions each can. There weren't large chunks of fat or gristle in any of the cans, which I've experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats. The proportion of liquids to meat was fair too, it's not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either, though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat. None of the meat was seasoned, at all. This is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring. There is a mild "spam"-like texture and taste to the meats(but way better than spam any day), almost a brine or something, that's why I heavily seasoned it. Don't plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats, it gave everything a slightly rancid, soury taste...no idea why! Due to the higher calories and higher price, I will only stock this as emergency food. I will buy more for that reason.
