Hard to find the wintergreen smalls [sugar free] as stores only have the red smalls [peppermint --such a common flavor]. The wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious. Driving cross country, if someone cuts me off, I turn to my daughter with my hand out and say "Wintergreen Me!" She pulls one out, puts it in my hand, and all is right with the world.
