Now, I haven't done a side-by-side comparison, but these chips still taste like the real deal. These snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store I work for. Portion control AND reduced fat? Yes, please!  With the Subscribe & Save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store.
