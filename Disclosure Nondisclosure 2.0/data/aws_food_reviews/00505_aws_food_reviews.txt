These are a favorite at our home. We like the ones that have Sea Salt. We also like Barbeque  flavored. These are not ruffly chips that have ridges. These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes. They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth. They also have a great taste. The sea salt ones, which are a favorite, have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chips.<br /><br />Enjoy.
