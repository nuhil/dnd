Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal!
