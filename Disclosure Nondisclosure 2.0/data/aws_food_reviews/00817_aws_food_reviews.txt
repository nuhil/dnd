If some other yahoo deems it ok to give give a suck review to this stuff because he doesn't like the taste, I feel I must assert that in this -as in all matters of taste- "De Gustibus Non Disputandem Est".<br /><br />I really love this gum. OK it doesn't really taste like strawberry, but it's still delicious. It has a wonderfully smooth consistency about halfway through, but then it gets tired, stuff, and squeaky.<br /><br />You'll forgive the squeaks perhaps when you find, as I did, that this stuff is a wonderful dietetic aid. By obsessively chewing this product I filled my gut with odorless room air and so helped me lose 25# in 3 months.<br /><br />Also, it doesn't lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight.
