I found deep inspiration in this song. I just wanted to post it in this forum, in hope that it may help one other person as much as it has me. 
 What I Cannot Change--By: LeAnn Rimes
 I know what makes me comfortable
I know what makes me tick
And when I need to get my way I know how to pour it on thick
 Cream and sugar in my coffee
Right away when I awake
I face the day and pray to God I won't make the same mistakes
Oh the rest is out of my hands
 (Chorus)
I will learn to let go what I cannot change
I will learn to forgive what I cannot change
I will learn to love what I cannot change
But I will change, I will change
Whatever I, whenever I can
 I don't know my Father
Or my Mother well enough
Seems like every time we talk we can't get past the little stuff
 The pain is self inflicted
I know it's not good for my health
But it's easier to please the world than it is to please myself 
Oh the rest is out of my hands
 (Chorus)
I will learn to let go what I cannot change
I will learn to forgive what I cannot change
I will learn to love what I cannot change
But I will change, I will change
Whatever I, whenever I can
 Right now I can't care about how everyone else will feel
I have enough hurt of my own to he
 I will learn to let go what I cannot change
I will learn to forgive what I cannot change
I will learn to let go what I cannot change
I will learn to forgive what I cannot change
I will learn to love what I cannot change
But I will change, I will change
Whatever I, whenever I can
