I'm a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to. I don't own a Nook. I don't own an iPad (and, in any case, that's comparing apples to oranges). I don't have a Sony e-reader. 'This will be a short, simple review.I received my Kindle about a week ago and haven't been able to put it down.Things I like about my Kindle1. The e-ink display is amazing.2. Using the 5-way controller is simple and effective.3. Page turn speeds are faster than I thought they would be.4. It's lightweight, even with the attached cover (I have an Amazon cover with a built-in light)5. Page-turning buttons are quiet and well-placed.6. Recharge time is fast.7. I can order a book and start reading it in less than 60 seconds. Nice!8. Portability... I can take 3,000 books with me when I travel for work and not require additional suitcases or baggage fees.Things I'm not too keen on1. Buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly.2. Lack of individual number buttons is frustrating.3. Power button on the bottom Not a bad thing. Just an odd thing. (Same for the headphone input). I usually rest the bottom of a book on my lap when I read.Things I hope change in the future1. How books are organized... When I put a book in a collection (which is actually a tag), it still appears in the main list. It's not actually moved, it's merely associated.2. The look of the main screen. I'd like folders or some other way to display collections.3. Ability to create personal screen savers.4. E-book pricing, though Amazon has little control over this.Read more
