I bought 2 of these for christmas presents and I have to say they aren't very kid friendly. Every kindle I've had in the past has been pretty easy to use, this one has a lot of options that I think could be elsewhere to make it easier for a child to navigate. They have an easier time using the other devices (kindle fire, or kindle app on their other tablets) which is unfortunate because I wanted them to be able to have something strictly for reading. Also for a kids bundle its very disappointing that most children's books don't work with this device. No where on the kids bundle page does it state this is an 8th generation kindle. Now, I have a few kindles and have bought new ones as they come out, but I haven't followed close enough to know this is an 8th generation without that information available on the page. I planned on buying these devices so bought a bunch of books listed as available for e-readers 5th generation. I assumed since it was the latest one listed, and my new devices didn't have anything listed, it was the latest. I just found out today that its an 8th generation and a lot of books aren't available on this device, with hopes that will change in the future. So now I have a lot of money spent on books they have to read on their old devices (the devices with games and access to the internet and videos). I spent extra money on 2 new devices so they had something to use daily without that access, all to find out their age appropriate books can't be read on their new devices. I think this information should be available to parents who are looking for a device they can sit their kids down with and not have to worry about them not focusing on something so important to them. Reading is important to children of all ages, and they can only read at their own levels.Read more
