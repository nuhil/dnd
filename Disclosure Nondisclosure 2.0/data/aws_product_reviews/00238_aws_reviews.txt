First day with the echo show. I'm pretty pleased with it. Some observations that I think have not been hit in most reviews:* Sound quality seems similar to that of the Echo cylinder. Good for a desktop listening experience, not impressive if you want to fill a room with sound.* The Show does have an ambient light sensor (using the camera) so that the screen dims as the room lighting goes down. When I darkened the room at night to work at my PC, the Show display dimmed to the point where I could just make out the time, and not the background photo at all.* Much has been made of the Show displaying lyrics when playing Prime music. That doesn't appeal to me, but when playing music from Spotify, Pandora, and My Music on Amazon, the Show displays the song title, artist name, album art, and a progress indicator. That's really nice when listening to playlists - I was always asking my Echo cylinder Alexa, what's that song* Alexa has always been weak at recognizing the names of some of my Pandora channels. With the show, if Alexa doesn't recognize the name, I can ask it to display my Pandora channels and select them fro mthe Show touch screen, It's good to have a fallback that does not require me to pull out my phone and fire up the Alexa app, then work my way through multiple screens to get my selection.* Some newsfeeds are now accompanied by appropriate photographs.* You can set the Show to use an album from Amazon Prime Photos as a slideshow when the device is inactive. AFAIK, other photo servers cannot be used.
