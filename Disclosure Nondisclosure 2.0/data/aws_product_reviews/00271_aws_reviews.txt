I am a fairly voracious reader - 120+ books/year, almost all on Kindle. I have purchased every Kindle edition as soon as it was announced. The price doesn't bother me too much, as I figure with as much as I read, I make the money back by buying Kindle vs. hardcover books (since I mostly read new releases). This is the first Kindle that I sent back though.It's not that the Oasis isn't great - it is. The display is slightly crisper than previous Kindles. It's not that it isn't set up well - the buttons are placed well and easy to use, and the touch screen works fine. It's really just a matter of personal preference. I love to read while I have coffee in the morning and while I'm eating lunch at work, and because of that I love the origami case that the Voyage has. It's hard to read the Oasis hands-free, especially if you are used to the Voyage. Also, when reading while laying down, I switch hands unconsciously a couple of times a minute. I didn't realize this until I used the Oasis, because with the Oasis you have to flip the Kindle over, which may not seem like a big deal, but it definitely does not create a seamless reading experience.So if you like to read while eating or laying down then you are probably better off using the Voyage. If you want the best looking read, then the Oasis is great. And regardless, you are better off reading any Kindle than you are watching the garbage on TV!
