First off,i appreciate you reading this review :) Just so you get a little background on me, we are major tech users. We have multiple tablets from apple,samsung,and asus. This fire tablet is comparable in a different way. This tablet uses a amazon based operating system, Fire os. So no play store or itunes... As a prime member however, this tablet is an incredible value because you get instant access to all of your prime benifits. Ive had a chance to really put this product thru its paces over the past 2 days. I ordered 2 of these tablets so me and my wife could really put these to use. We have Gone thru 3 full power cycles (fully charging and fully draining the battery thru use) it does get 10-11 hours of hefty use so battery life is a plus! This tablet is a keeper. Screen looks fantastic. Colors seem to be just slightly dull however the resoloution for everyday use is perfect for this price point. Speed is snappy enough for basic use and handles more complex tasks and games without much issue. On a passmark benchmark test i got a score of 3377. However the second HD 8 constantly grades about 30-35 points lower. So it is a possibility that even tho you have the same exact tablet,they might be built slightly different so performance will vary. At this price point I didnt expect them to come out exactly the same. This tablet is bassically the same specs as the samsung tab a at half the price! Oh and the hd 8 actually offers a slightly better resoloution then the samsung! Minus one star for the wifi connection. I have lost connection several times on both tablets. Seems to only happen on my 5g connection.Also the screen being so reflective,it is impossible to use at all outdoors.also sadly is a fingerprint magnet.Read more
