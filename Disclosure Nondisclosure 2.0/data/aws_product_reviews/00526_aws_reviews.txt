1. While a great idea to make the cover self-standing, it's annoying that it's floppy when not in use.2. I bought the cover because my first Kindle didn't have a cover and often got left on, wearing down the battery. My second Kindle cover had the convenient feature of automatically opening and closing the device. So I wanted that feature on my third Kindle. Even though I think it's over priced, I like the convenience.3. My other cover was black, which often got lost on dark surfaces. This time I got the denim blue, so it's much easier to find from a distance.
