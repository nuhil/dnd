I typically don't post reviews however don't waste your money on this case. I got it on Friday and started using it that evening. Its now Thursday and the case is peeling at the edges, the fabric around the camera hole has started bubbling, and the felt on the inside edge is wearing off. i have not had any issues with it standing on its own like other people have mentioned. I am giving this a two star mainly because it is still functional. I am tempted to send it back but I like the functionality of this case.
