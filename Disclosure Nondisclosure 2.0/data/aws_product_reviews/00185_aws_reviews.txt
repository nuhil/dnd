This is my second one and it is great! It can be used as a remote also. It was easy to pair with my Fire TV. I received my first one when I purchased the Gaming Edition of Fire TV and I liked it so much that I bought a second one for my son. He is a gamer and he was very happy with it.I would recommend this product for anyone who is a gamer. There are many more games available for the Fire TV and they play flawlessly on the Fire TV
