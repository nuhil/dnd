This is a great case! It allows access to all ports and camera, while not taking from the protection of the tablet itself. It feels very durable, and I think it would protect the Fire well against accidental drops, bumps and scratches. As a blind individual, touch is very important to me. This product feels well made. It feels expensive, and I'm certain looks the same. The standing feature is great, it stands well for movie viewing or apps that do better in landscape. This is a great accessory for the new Fire 7. I'm sure there will be other companies making cases for it. But this is how the folks at Amazon envisioned their device, and it is amazing! Don't be fooled in to buying a cheaper product. Amazon devices do best with amazon accessories.
