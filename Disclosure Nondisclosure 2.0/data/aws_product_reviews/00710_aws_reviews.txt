First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle. I love reading on this machine and for the price, amazon did a good job with this one.Read more
