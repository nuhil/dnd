Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen. There has to be something I can do. I looked and search and what I found is the Fabric Case for Alexa. This is it! A support she will be happy to wear. No more accidental popping out, no more shifting and readjusting, she is finally safe.
