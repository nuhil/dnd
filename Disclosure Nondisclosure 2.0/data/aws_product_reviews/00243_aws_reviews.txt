I've owned several different tablets. This one is by far the slowest. And I don't mean it's a little slower. I mean you have to wait up to 2 minutes sometimes for the apps to load onto the screen. Opening apps can be quick or take up to 3 minutes. I've had far more issues with this Fire than any of the others we've owned. If I had realized the difference in speed I would have kept my old one. It's definitely not work the larger screen. It's a crap shoot on a daily basis on how fast it will be. But even on it's fastest day it's significantly slower than the others.
