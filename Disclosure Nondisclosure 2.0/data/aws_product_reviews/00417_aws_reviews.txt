This is a wonderful streaming device. I have been an Apple TV man since 2008, but I have decided that I just might never return to my Apple TV. I have used/owned all 3 generations and have known them inside and out (unlocked my 1st generation for secret stuff. Shhhh) and swore by them for years. I just received my amazon fire tv device this afternoon and plugged it up without a hitch. Voice command is a nice touch, but I was most impressed with the speed of the quad core processor. No more waiting for my videos to buffer, and this is especially important in my house where my wife, kids, and I are sometimes simultaneously streaming videos. Final word: If you're just looking for a great device to stream both Netflix and Amazon Prime, then you've found the right streamer.
