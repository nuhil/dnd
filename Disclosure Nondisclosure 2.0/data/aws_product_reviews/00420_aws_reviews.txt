I got mine from an electronics store, because I didn't want to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Setup was a breeze. I don't have cable, so prior to this, I had to hook my laptop up to my TV to enjoy Prime and Netflix content on it. I'm also really pleased that they added a YouTube app That was the number one drawback for me when considering this device. From what I've read, I figured I'd sideload one, but they saved me the trouble.Once I signed in to YouTube and linked my mobile devices, I even gained the ability to send content to my TV for viewing I don't have a Fire phone or Kindle (although I do have a Paperwhite), so I'm not able to comment on the connectivity with those.I can't say enough good things about this tiny box. I've had it for a couple of months and use it every day The user interface is intuitive and efficient. I really love the screen saver pictures, too. Most of them are breathtaking, and they seem to update periodically. The voice search is very accurate. There are a decent amount of apps for added content. I mostly stick to the abovementioned sources, but I added Crackle for a bit of variety.My only complaint would be about the rewind/fast forward. It's not intuitive, and takes some getting used to. I don't use that feature often, so it's no biggie to me.I did feel a bit weird about not being able to turn it off at first, but I got used to that, too. Just make sure to press the Home button when you're done for the evening or whatever, because you leave it paused in the middle of a show or something, it won't go to sleep. It remembers your place in whatever you were watching, so no worries about that.I look forward to continued software improvements, and plan on getting a game controller sometime soon, so I can try out the games.
