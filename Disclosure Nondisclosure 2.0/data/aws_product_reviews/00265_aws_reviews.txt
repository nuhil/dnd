This is my 4th Kindle since I bought my first one as soon as Kindle was launched. With every new model, I was fascinated by the improvements and kept recommending them to friends. The Voyager was the first time I felt somewhat frustrated with an Amazon product.Yes, it is lighter and even easier to read than my previous models - if you are buying your first one, don't hesitate - it is still a great product and still much more comfortable to use than trying to read a book on an iPad - even if it is an iPad Mini.But... There are a few things that I thing Amazon should fix on this one, specially because it is the top of the line Kindle:1. The battery cover just keeps disconnecting from the reader itself. The magnetic attachment is just not strong enough to keep it in position as you manipulate the reader. Previous covers just stayed in place and even the Apple magnetic cover attaches better than this one.2. As you are able to turn off the page buttons on the side, you should be able to turn off page turning on the screen. The way I got used to handle the kindle and as I constantly change hands when I am reading, I get a lot of undesired page turns because I touched the screen somewhere. A very simple fix that could be in one of the next software updates that would greatly improve my perception of the device.3. Battery life (even with the cover) is far from what I expected. My old Kindle had a battery that lasted for more than a month, the new one needs recharging every 15 days.4. The device itself is so light and the battery cover so cumbersome that it should come with a simple,e cover just to protect the screen when you throw it in the bag.5.Read more
