I already had an original Kindle Paperwhite and loved it. Buying this in addition seemed like a bit of an indulgence but I am so pleased I made this move. I love the new font and the clarity of the screen. I love that the Kindle comes to life when I open the cover (I bought a new cover with the magnetic clasp). While there is nothing dramatic about the evolving of the Kindle there are enough changes and improvements for me to feel I have made a great purchase which I am happy with. I also have a bunch of books from my Amazon.co.uk site which I access on my 'old' Kindle (I couldn't work out how, if at all, I can move books from one Amazon jurisdiction to another) so this has proved a good purchase all round.
