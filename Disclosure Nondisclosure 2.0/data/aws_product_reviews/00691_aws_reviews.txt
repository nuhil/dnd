Having a tablet or a phone is inevitable in our life and there is nothing we can do about it. And I know, there are toddlers over there who can read a book in a cart while grocery shopping or just curiously looking around. But that's not our case. Our daughter is three years old, and she's a very nice girl, but she hates grocery shopping, she gets bored very easily and the only thing that helps, are her favorite cartoons.Earlier we gave her my or my husband's phone, but it's so easy for a toddler to drop things down, so we made a decision to buy her a tablet. The price was a trigger for us to buy Fire HD Kids Edition.We did not have the previous edition, but as far as I know, the only difference between them are that the 7th gen Fire 7 has a dual-band WiFi antenna and a slightly newer GPU.At first, we considered buying a 50 Fire 7 (regular one), but there are so many benefits in the kid's edition, that it's definitely worth to pay an extra 50 for it. And those benefits, that were important for us, are: - Kid-Proof Case. That's a must have! I chose the pink one for my daughter and she seems to like it. - 2-year worry-free guarantee. - One year of FreeTime Unlimited. She will love all the apps and game that are free. - I can choose what content my daughter will watch.The battery life is great, my daughter is still too little to watch cartoons for more than an hour a day, so it should work on a single charge for a week, or so.The display quality is just ok, I expected it to be at least better than the previous version (my nephew has it), but it's just the same.During the first day it has been dropped, and thrown, and kicked and it survived.Read more
