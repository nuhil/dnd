Bought this on Deal of the Day which surprised me since it is new to Best Buy. Just push the button and ask "her" to do something such as play favorite radio station or music from play list. Have "her" set timers and alarms to wake by. I haven't used half of the features of TAP. The sound is amazingly great for such a small device.
