I like the case for the primary reason that I bought it--to protect my new kindle, but as a stand it has its drawbacks. I am not comfortable at all with trying to use it in the vertical position, and in the horizontal it is stable enough for watching movies or videos, but at home I have another stand that I use if I am playing any of my games on the tablet. Good price, and I am pleased with it as protection for my tablet. Not near as pleased with it as a viable stand.
