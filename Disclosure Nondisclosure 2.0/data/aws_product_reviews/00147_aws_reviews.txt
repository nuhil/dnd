Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version. For my 7 version review, please search for my HDX 7 review.My profile: Im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine.
