As a Kindle case, this works, but it's got a few too many negatives.To the good, it's nice and thick, meaning it gives good protection, and your Kindle snaps into it rather than just sitting in it like my 7 HDX's magnetic case, meaning your Kindle won't fall out if you tip it too far.However.1. I hate the flap this has for propping it up. Maybe I was spoiled by my last Kindle's case, but I had one of the magnetic origami ones, and the case folded into a very solid support that would hold the Kindle up on either of the long sides. This one's flap isn't magnetic, and it's just one diagonal fold, which makes gives far less support. The thing tips over or collapses more than I'd like it to, and if I want to read in landscape orientation (i.e. the long sides go left to right rather than up and down), the top and bottom aren't interchangeable. That wouldn't normally be a problem, but...2. There's a camera on the back of the Kindle 8, and the case has a hole for it. The problem is, there's only one hole, which means there's a right way and a wrong way to put the Kindle into it. Like I said, none of this would normally be a problem, except I sometimes use it while it's charging, and my outlet is on the left side of the bed. Naturally, the stand puts the USB thing on the right side of the Kindle. Assuming I don't want to cover the camera, I can either prop it up while I read, or let it charge while I read, but not both. (I'll probably order a longer USB cable, but the one the Kindle comes with is too short to wrap around to the other side.) I wish they'd punched two holes in the back and given us options for which direction the Kindle fits.3. It's got a canvassy sort of fabric covering rather than a hard plastic one like my last case.Read more
