I LOVE this!!!! Although it doesn't show color, (which is about the only thing I don't love about it) it is still very cool. I got it when I was 9, back in 2015, and loved it! It doesn't show ads, which I really love, since does ANYONE like those pesky ads Very good product, and totally worth your money.
