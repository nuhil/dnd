Okay, if you don't want to read my whole review, I'll summarize it right here: The Oasis is the most technologically advanced e-ink reader that Amazon - or anyone else, for that matter - has produced to date. But is it worth 290 for the least expensive version (wi-fi only with ads) In my opinion, the answer is no, not when the very capable Paperwhite is available for 100 (at the time I'm writing this). But I'm sure that there is a market for the Oasis, probably for the techno-geeks and gadgeteers like myself who love trying new products like the Oasis, and serious readers who want the absolute best possible experience in reading. But for the typical reader, I just don't think the Oasis adds enough to the reading experience to be worth the high price, especially for those who already have a Paperwhite or Voyage.For reference, here's a brief comparison of the Oasis with the Paperwhite and the Voyage:Oasis (2016)-----------------------------Size: 5.6x4.8x0.13-0.33 (thickness varies)Weight (wi-fi version): 4.6 ounces (without battery case)Display: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED front-litStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: Touchscreen plus page turn buttonsNumber of fonts: 9Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lighting (10 LEDs)Third Generation Paperwhite (2015)------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.Read more
