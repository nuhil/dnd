I'm a long time Kindle user, and have upgraded a number of times. Every upgrade was a significant improvement, and the Oasis continues that trend. I love my Voyage, but the Oasis makes it feel like a hardback book. The pictures and descriptions don't do the size and weight justice. Shockingly light, and small even with the case. Used without the case, it's like holding a few sheets of paper. Amazing. Haven't had it long enough to evaluate the battery life, but never had a problem with the previous models, so I assume the promise of much longer battery life (with the secondary battery in the case) is accurate.The balance in the hand without the case is stunningly good. With the case feels a bit like the Voyage (although quite a bit lighter than my Voyage in its case). Case is high quality and easy to put on and take off as needed. Screen seems a smidge clearer and higher definition than my Voyage (maybe due to the updated lighting system).I had the 'pressure sensitive' page turner option on my Voyage turned off. Much too jumpy and sensitive, even at its 'hard' setting. I won't miss that. The new mechanical buttons on the Oasis are AWESOME. Nice upgrade there, and nice to not have to touch the screen for the most part.Yes, it is pricey. I would say if you are a 'few hour a week' reader, the Paperwhite is your best bet (solid performance and very good price/value). But if you are a reading fanatic who reads a lot every day (like me!), the extra battery life and the balance/size/weight, along with the slightly improved screen is WELL worth the money, especially when spread over the life of the unit.Edit: A few more comments now that I've been using the Oasis for a number of months.Read more
