The Fire HD 8 kids tablet is essentially an HD 8 with the kids cover, FreeTime, and a 2 year warranty. Lots of improvements over the previous kids edition tablet such as dual band wifi, higher quality 720p screen, Dolby stereo speakers, double the storage, and increased battery life.The kids cover allows your little one to get a good grip on it and also provides exceptional protection from drops. The IPS screen has excellent viewing angles, vibrant colors, and offers plenty of brightness indoors. However once you move outside the screen will wash out if you're in the sun. The dual speakers give you true stereo sound and offer plenty of volume. It's a shame that the cameras don't offer higher resolution, but none the less the rear cam does take a decent picture even if your hands aren't that steady. Should you fill up the internal storage you can add up to a 256GB microSD card.FreeTime has a wealth of content, and it includes a kid-safe web browser that will only load sites that are whitelisted by you or Amazon. If you don't want your child using the browser then it can be turned off. You can also restrict access to certain categories, set time limits, and view what your children are watching and reading with the Parent Dashboard. After the first year there is a nominal fee to continue using the service.Tips:- You can view Amazon videos offline when not connected to wifi. Switch to your adult profile and download the video(s). Now go into settings, profiles and family library, select your child profile, add content, videos, and select your videos.- You can sideload Google Play and gain access to even more apps such as YouTube Kids.- You can set FreeTime to only allow entertainment content after daily educational goals have been met.
