For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected! The camera isn't great however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is) Smooth and responsive Easy access to amazon prime content Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV Battery life Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having Camera quality isn't great and no flash Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads. The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen. No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things. The gigs may or may not matter to you. 8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig. If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series. However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 7 series are great! For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers. The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers. Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.Read more
