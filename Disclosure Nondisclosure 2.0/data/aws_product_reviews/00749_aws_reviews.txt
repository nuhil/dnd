Amazon has just updated their bargain priced Fire tablets. While these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation, I believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market. Its still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks, and its such a good all-around performer (for the most part)!I purchased both the 7 and 8 Fire models because I wanted to see how they compared, and I was curious how they performed. They are both shown in the video attached to this review. I will focus here on the 7 model, to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive 8 Fire tablet is worth the extra money (and if the 7 model is worth purchasing on its own merits).I've given this 7 model a 4-star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output (see detailed comments below). It is still a terrific bargain at the price, but I do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses.SUMMARY- These new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation Fire tablets:--- Same display specs as before (Amazon says the 7 model has an improved display), same processors (1.3 GHz quad-core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation), same standard and available storage (7 8 or 16 GB 8 16 or 32 GB)--- New colors--- the 8 model is 10 cheaper--- the 7 model now has dual band wi-fi (previously single band wi-fi) for better connectivity--- Kids edition now available for both models (previously only the 7 model).Read more
