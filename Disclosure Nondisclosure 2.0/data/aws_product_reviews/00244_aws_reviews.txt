I've had the Kindle Fire HDX 7 inch tablet for almost 3 years and when I compare it to the Fire HD 10, the earlier tablet comes out the big winner. I find the larger tablet considerably slower. Several apps load quite slowly. The battery is consumed much more quickly. Maybe this is not comparing apples with apples, but I had expected at least the same speed.
