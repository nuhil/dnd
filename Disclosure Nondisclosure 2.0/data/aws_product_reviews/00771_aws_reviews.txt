I have been using advanced technology for the last 20 years. It was born out of necessity not convenience. My wife passed away 4 years ago leaving me, not only a widow, but a widowed quadriplegic trying to survive on his own. We were married 20 years and yes she married me when I was already paralyzed. She was a beautiful lady here on earth and I am sure she is just as beautiful in God's presence. I have to attest that it has been an arduous journey. But one thing that has made it possible for me to live on my own even though I am paralyzed from the chest down, is smart technology. For example, I am able to run my entire home with apps on my phone, computer or tablet. I have lights, electric door locks, electric bed, air-conditioning/heat, cameras, both indoor and out side. Smart technology allows me to input data on my laptop when I am laying in bed I cannot use my arms when I am laying flat in bed because of the paralysis. Up to this point, I have used input through joysticks that operate by using my mouth. They work effectively but the joysticks must be placed specifically in front of my mouth and they have to remain there all night long. Smart technology allows me to be able to live safely on my own and has even allowed me to help take care of my 75-year-old mother whose health is, due to God's grace and technology, now stable and she is actually helping me more each day. Alexa has been a blessing beyond my imagination. She has given me an opportunity that I never thought would be possible. I still use the joystick input because they are reliable and not subject to Wi-Fi disruption but Alexis is growing more dependable each day. At this point I have only an echo Dot, but I am ordering, when funds allow, the regular echo and another Dot as well.Read more
