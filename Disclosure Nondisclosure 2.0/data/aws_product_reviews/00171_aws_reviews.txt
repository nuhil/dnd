Without an on / off button, I have found that the controller comes on (the light comes on showing it's connected to the FireTV) even when not in use. I am assuming this is why the batteries were draining so quick. Now, I put the remote into a 2nd room when I am not using it and the batteries last a normal lifespan. The light never turns on know when the remote is in the other room.
