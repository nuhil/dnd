Really awesome tablet for my 5 year olds, and worth the money. Easy to figure out (for the most part), tons of apps, books and videos. My only complaint is that you cannot separate downloaded apps from the thousands of apps available to download on freetime. There is a carousel on the home page, but only shows the recently used apps. My children would have to scroll through the thousands of apps to find the ones that are downloaded with a check mark in the corner. I didn't want them to be able to download everything they see, which is easy to do with just a tap. The only solution I found was to block every app except those that are downloaded. You would think there would be an option separate them, given that this is made for a child, but I guess not
