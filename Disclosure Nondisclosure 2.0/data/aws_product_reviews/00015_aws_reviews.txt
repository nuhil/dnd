I love my kindle! I got one for my fiance on his birthday, he loved it!!!!!!! so I decided to get one for myself as well and I am glad I did. It is very easy to read books in it. I LOVE the dictionary on this little device. Normally I just skip a word I don't know the meaning of and try to guess what it means in the context but with kindle, I just press and hold my finger on the word I don't know and translation pops up! so essentially, the meaning of a new word is at your finger tips! )If you love to read books, I highly recommend kindle.However, if you only read Manga or Comic books, if you are a fan of buying how to draw, how to sew books I do not recommend kindle for you. It is not easy to navigate trough pictures and slides.So if you are a fan of reading novels just buy it now!If you are a manga fan, just buy your manga books from bookstores.
