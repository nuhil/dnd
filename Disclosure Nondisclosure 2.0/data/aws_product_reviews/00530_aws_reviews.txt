My primary concern is the price when comparing to other solutions. Nevertheless, has received the and installed the product I believe that I meets my specific needs and expectation. This case is unlikely to protect my Fire HD in a 5-foot drop. It does, however, protect my kindle from spills and low drops. What I want and what I have is the ability to, without forethought, turn off the Kindle when the cover is closed to save power. Moreover, whether by design or oversight the fact that the SD Card is covered (e.g. you need to remove the case to access the SD slot) this is a good thing. All in all I am impressed with product 's fit (e.g. the camera hole is perfectly aligned.), the tablet speakers are well positioned for audio and the case folds into both landscape and portrait support positions,Bottom-line I'm happy with the purchase and can recommend it to others for consideration.
