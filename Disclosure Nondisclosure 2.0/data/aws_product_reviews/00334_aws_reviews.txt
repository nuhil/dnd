Wasn't sure how this would work with my rural DSL but it is WONDERFUL. I haven't had any problems with it at all. It is easy to use and the voice command works just as they said it would. So very, very glad I bought it. Loads of stuff to watch. I have been able to catch up with some series I have missed, especially the BBC ones that I dearly love. I recommend it to anyone who likes variety in what they can watch. Along with my Amazon Prime most everything is FREE..that is an added bonus. Try it, you'll like it.
