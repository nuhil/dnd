<p>I have a ASP.NET application that we've written our own logging module for.</p>

<p>My question is, where is the standard place to write a log file to? I.e. the website will be running as the anonymous user identity (e.g. IUSR on IIS7) and I need a place where I know it'll have permission to write to.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
